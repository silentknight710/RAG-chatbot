    "podcasting career that's the magic of",
    "naal ravikant Nal rant Nal ravikant",
    "founder of Angel Del no rikan Naro rakan",
    "the founder of angelist which is a giant",
    "business I mean Global I I wonder if",
    "you've ever thought of that reality if",
    "your parents didn't leave India and go",
    "to the US how would your life be",
    "different according to you the first",
    "time I used an Apple computer it was an",
    "old Macintosh I just fell in love with",
    "it at some point if you have high agency",
    "you will end up where you're meant to go",
    "it's just going to take some effort did",
    "it do anything for your mind I kind of",
    "sometimes have these near-death",
    "exercises where it's just like I imagine",
    "myself dying it's like you can see",
    "things fading out they call orgasm the",
    "petite more The Little Death right did",
    "you ever smoke weed you know I live in",
    "California well the common belief now is",
    "that like mushrooms are harmless right",
    "they're",
    "not do you miss your childhood I don't",
    "have a it's like a dream is it real",
    "actually",
    "happened B has had a great saying in",
    "every human there is a sense that",
    "something infinite has been lost wow has",
    "marriage brought further understanding",
    "when it comes to life there's a secret",
    "to a happy relationship is to happy",
    "people you know what I've learned about",
    "marriage one's wife is always right and",
    "that's the rule one should follow yes I",
    "reject that completely uh yeah people",
    "say like happy wife happy life that's",
    "all propaganda that's all feminine",
    "propaganda you're being brainwashed no",
    "both people have to be equally happy",
    "really you know from the outside looking",
    "in I personally have this impression of",
    "Naval rikan the brand and the human and",
    "I feel like nothing hurts that guy I'm a",
    "very paranoid person so my rule is I",
    "don't fight with people if somebody",
    "wants to fight with me we get one fight",
    "and then it's over there's a lot of",
    "people out there and life is long do you",
    "pray if you are older in life and you",
    "don't have the Next Generation to look",
    "forward to then you better find God fast",
    "because I don't think like your own mind",
    "and your own life will be kind to you as",
    "you get older",
    "if you know who Naval ravikant is please",
    "head straight into the conversation this",
    "intro is primarily crafted for those of",
    "you who are being introduced to Naval",
    "ravikant for the first time surprisingly",
    "there's a lot of people in India who are",
    "yet to be introduced to who I consider",
    "to be the greatest philosopher of our",
    "times I genuinely believe that history",
    "will remember him as one of the greatest",
    "Minds that lived in the 21st century",
    "he's an extremely humble extremely",
    "relaxed individual so I know that this",
    "intro is going to bother him on some",
    "level that's the side of Naval that I",
    "got to know through this conversation",
    "this is the most casual conversation",
    "that the internet has ever seen with",
    "this man it was one of the biggest",
    "honors of my own podcasting career to be",
    "sharing screen space and podcasting",
    "space with Naval ravikant if I had to",
    "introduce him professionally of course",
    "I'd tell you how he's one of the most",
    "iconic Angel Investors in the world of",
    "course i' tell you about how he's one of",
    "the most important thought leaders for",
    "Silicon Valley and the world of Global",
    "Twitter or X it's Naval ravikant on the",
    "RV show this is one of the most",
    "memorable episodes for me on a personal",
    "level but if you're looking for depth in",
    "conversation it doesn't get deeper than",
    "Naval rikan's mind it's Naval on",
    "TRS huge day for my career honestly huge",
    "day for my own Human Experience",
    "enjoy the",
    "[Music]",
    "episode this is one of the biggest days",
    "of my podcasting career but I'm also",
    "feeling supremely comfortable that's the",
    "magic of Nel ravian oh you're very nice",
    "welcome to the ren show sir thank you",
    "thanks for having me uh visualize this",
    "moment so much over the years so as I",
    "told you in the car ride on the way here",
    "uh I'm full of gratitude and as we go",
    "forward in this conversation I'm going",
    "to pour more and more gratitude on you",
    "uh when we were on our way here from the",
    "network state conference I saw how much",
    "you were hounded uh people just want to",
    "come up and say that they love you uh",
    "this takes me back to that Joe Rogan",
    "episode you did in 2019 are you aware of",
    "how many young men's lives that episode",
    "affected I have no idea why to be honest",
    "I feel like I just said the same things",
    "I was saying they're kind of obvious and",
    "maybe uh don't be so easily influenced",
    "really yeah think for yourself you know",
    "decide for yourself you know how I look",
    "at it so in 2019 I was 26 running four",
    "businesses parall getting extremely",
    "stressed out but those two hours of that",
    "episode created switches in me and my",
    "journey from age 26 to age 31 has been",
    "much more lubricated especially from a",
    "mental health perspective so you've done",
    "a lot for the mental health of many men",
    "all over the world how how much do we",
    "really figure out ourselves right",
    "there's like there there's what are the",
    "different kinds of knowledge this weth",
    "thinking through right I'm just thinking",
    "it through with you so there's Knowledge",
    "from direct experience right you",
    "experience something and that generates",
    "knowledge inside of you there's",
    "knowledge that you pick up from other",
    "sources you just a vessel that's passing",
    "through you you picked it up you",
    "synthesize it you",
    "regurgitate there's uh knowledge that",
    "you create which is rare um um I don't",
    "know if I said anything original really",
    "yeah I don't know I don't know but I",
    "think you accumulated a lot of data",
    "which is back by years of reading and",
    "research I think if I were to look back",
    "I would say that the only true knowledge",
    "I have is the knowledge that is uh",
    "directly verified by me and uh fits in",
    "with the other pieces so I view myself",
    "as a very basic thinker really yeah I",
    "don't view myself as an advanced thinker",
    "I'm not an expert in anything but what I",
    "like to do is everything that comes my",
    "way I like to deeply understand it as",
    "simply as possible I have to be able to",
    "put it in simple words and simple",
    "Frameworks and simple Concepts and I",
    "have to be able to do it uh almost",
    "visually in my mind and exponentially",
    "have to map it to some experience that I",
    "have and then I have to be able to take",
    "that and I have to be able to plug it",
    "into something else I understand it has",
    "to fit in a steel frame of understanding",
    "at the basics of knowledge uh so for",
    "example mathematics I was never very",
    "good at mathematics I wanted to be a",
    "physicist but I I wasn't good at",
    "calculus but my basic math is really",
    "really good um the same way I don't have",
    "the largest vocabulary but I have a very",
    "solid vocabulary and I can be very",
    "precise with my words even when I speak",
    "I'm not the fastest speaker I'm not the",
    "slowest speaker so I think for me it's",
    "just about I don't take there's a great",
    "uh motto from the Royal Society which",
    "was the Society of scientists in uh",
    "Britain during their Enlightenment era",
    "and uh the motto of the royal so Society",
    "is nullus and verba I'm sorry if I'm",
    "mangling the Latin but it means take no",
    "one's word for it and I love that uh",
    "take no one's word for it so I think uh",
    "we are encouraged these days to take in",
    "knowledge pour it into our heads like a",
    "bucket and uh we regurgitate it and we",
    "use fancy words to cover up what we",
    "don't mean what we don't know and I",
    "don't accept that unless I understand",
    "something at its core fundamental level",
    "I don't understand it and then beyond",
    "that level I get bored I don't care to",
    "understand it so I think just being able",
    "to be very particular about what you",
    "take in make sure you truly understand",
    "it and that it is true truth is the most",
    "important thing because if you're going",
    "ahead with falsehoods because they're",
    "convenient you're just going to walk",
    "around bumping your head against reality",
    "and wondering why it hurts so it's",
    "important to just always look for the",
    "truth figure it out for yourself make",
    "sure it fits into your understanding be",
    "open to revising it because you're",
    "always wrong it's just question of how",
    "wrong you are uh and then using that to",
    "uh find the commonalities in life and",
    "and navigate it and I think that's why",
    "uh you're better off asking someone like",
    "me about very basic things uh than about",
    "very Advanced things can I ask you a",
    "basic question sure yeah please what's",
    "the meaning of",
    "life we talk about this for hours I",
    "think about it all the time I think",
    "about it I I want to kind of reframe it",
    "a little bit sure yeah uh what's new",
    "right now in life for you it's been 5",
    "years since that Joe Rogan episode and",
    "we got to know you so deeply then yeah",
    "but what's happened in the last five",
    "years I don't I don't I don't uh",
    "retrospect on myself I don't think about",
    "myself that's what's new no no I just",
    "don't I I couldn't tell you because I",
    "don't think about myself I don't think",
    "about what's changed in my life and if",
    "my life is good or bad or if this",
    "happened or that happened and I don't",
    "look at all photos of me and I don't",
    "think about old trips and I think about",
    "people that are gone you know I don't I",
    "don't think about the past I just don't",
    "live in the past at all do you pray uh",
    "not in the traditional sense no uh I",
    "think prayer implies some kind of an",
    "external entity that I'm asking",
    "something for and sure like every person",
    "I might have done that here or there um",
    "usually we're fair weather friends with",
    "any God that's out there right when we",
    "need help we're like all prayer and when",
    "we don't we're like everything's good",
    "it's all me right so no I don't I don't",
    "pray in the traditional sense",
    "uh but I am very deeply I hate the word",
    "but it's spiritual right and I would",
    "Define spiritual in a negative way it",
    "just means not mental not physical right",
    "so but why do you hate the",
    "words because it's overloaded with a lot",
    "of religiosity um all of a sudden you're",
    "supposed to be a spiritual being you're",
    "supposed to do yoga you're supposed to",
    "meditate and you're supposed to sit",
    "cross- lugged and you're supposed to you",
    "know then you argue about is the bagat",
    "Gita or the asash Gita or the you know",
    "all of these roads lead to the same",
    "place um the the the best way I would SU",
    "Ariz my thinking on this is that I think",
    "existence itself is a miracle the oldest",
    "questions are why is there something",
    "instead of nothing why are we here",
    "what's the meaning of life these are all",
    "just variants in the same question and",
    "there is no answer to that does that",
    "mean there can never be an answer to",
    "that no not necessarily but if you start",
    "going down that road you'll find all",
    "kinds of contradictions for example with",
    "just the meaning of life right if there",
    "was a single meaning of life then we",
    "would all be slaves to it suppose the",
    "meaning of life was to help others and",
    "we would all be running around trying to",
    "help others and you know there'd be no",
    "room for the individual if the meaning",
    "of life was to you know be strong and",
    "fit and healthy then we'd all be working",
    "out um we'd all be I don't know how beer",
    "and biceps go together but you know we'd",
    "all be building our biceps so it's",
    "better that there is no overarching",
    "singular meaning of life it's better",
    "that there are personal interpretations",
    "got um however within those personal",
    "interpretations you know we we all have",
    "even though we have complete freedom to",
    "choose any meaning that we want and we",
    "can create our own meaning at any moment",
    "um",
    "there are certain common things in what",
    "we all want as well and so that's kind",
    "of the Paradox of being a human",
    "individual where you're completely an",
    "individual but you're also completely",
    "Interlink to everything and anything",
    "that exists you couldn't change you",
    "couldn't change a particle in the",
    "universe without changing this moment",
    "right not in any meaningful way um",
    "although that's not entirely true there",
    "are error correcting mechanisms built",
    "into into the structure of the universe",
    "so uh but a lot of things had to cons in",
    "a very particular way to bring us here",
    "together today right um so in that sense",
    "everything is very interconnected on the",
    "other",
    "hand my life is and your lives are",
    "single player games inside our heads you",
    "know we interpret everything from birth",
    "to death uh your experience of uh your",
    "experiences are singular to you uh no",
    "one will truly ever understand you or",
    "get you uh and you're always searching",
    "for that Unity that connection that that",
    "going back to uh you know Oneness Source",
    "togetherness whatever you want to call",
    "it Community there's many words for",
    "it in terms of uh you know back to",
    "meaning of life the way I think of it is",
    "that existence itself is a miracle and",
    "everything else is science and I think",
    "that's the best of all possible worlds",
    "so spirituality is a side that lies on",
    "what who am I why am I here how long",
    "have I got what am I here for and these",
    "are questions that are really only",
    "answerable at a personal level this",
    "miraculous little world that we're in is",
    "beautifully put together I couldn't I",
    "couldn't do a better job for sure for",
    "sure I couldn't even begin to do the job",
    "and just to give you some ideas as to",
    "you know just some observations how well",
    "it's put together the fact that science",
    "works that's magic technology works that",
    "is Magic you go back and you read books",
    "on magic or magicians or fantasy books",
    "they don't have a hundred of the power",
    "that we have they don't have",
    "self-driving cars they don't have",
    "smartphones they don't have antibiotics",
    "they don't have Rockets um they don't",
    "even have fantasy novels they don't even",
    "have clean running water they don't have",
    "reliable food they don't have food",
    "delivery services right uh so we are",
    "already living in an age of Miracles",
    "that the best part is we can control and",
    "the magic spells that we cast are under",
    "the opice of science the Wizardry that",
    "we create is through technology and",
    "that's all manipulable through laws and",
    "and rules and systems that we discover",
    "and we discover and we create and that",
    "is incredible we're all magicians I",
    "wouldn't I couldn't ask for a better",
    "system if an actual Miracle showed up",
    "afterwards supposed somebody showed up",
    "and turned uh loaves into fish or water",
    "into wine that would destroy our world",
    "because all of a sudden you be like oh",
    "my God there's all these rules for this",
    "new thing that we don't understand how",
    "it works so now science is junk and you",
    "wouldn't know how to navigate the world",
    "and now You' be the mercy of demons and",
    "angels and spirits and you'd be running",
    "around worshiping and praying then you",
    "would pray because you'd be like how do",
    "I make sense of this world so I think we",
    "live in the best of all possible worlds",
    "okay uh I think the geography that one",
    "grows up in definitely determines their",
    "mindset in life to a large degree",
    "and uh personally my take on",
    "spirituality is affected by growing up",
    "in India you read books like the",
    "autobiography of your Yogi you read the",
    "life of the Buddha uh I definitely feel",
    "that there's a higher stage of",
    "Consciousness and I don't feel like",
    "we've reach the final state of evolution",
    "uh there is definitely an end point",
    "which is also beyond the next stage of",
    "evolution uh and I do believe that you",
    "know you say that Cal a calm mind is",
    "earned MH I think that's one of the",
    "steps on the ladder and then there's",
    "like higher stage",
    "mhm I I don't know how useful it is to",
    "prognosticate about where humanity is",
    "headed unless you get there yourself",
    "first uh and and you don't have the",
    "ability to do anything for anyone unless",
    "you embody it yourself uh so so to the",
    "extent that you think humanity is headed",
    "there I say get there first and then",
    "show them the way I definitely think",
    "that Nal rant is already on that ladder",
    "as compared to other human beings I have",
    "no idea where I'm on that ladder you",
    "don't think you're slightly more",
    "evolved no I I",
    "don't that's a loaded question",
    "uh first of all I don't think of myself",
    "I I just want to be clear on that and",
    "that's not a rule it's just a habit I've",
    "kind of developed because I found that",
    "thinking about yourself is a source of",
    "all unhappiness and misery really yes",
    "self-obsession is the root of all",
    "unhappiness what did Buddha do conquer",
    "the self what does that mean means that",
    "he saw through the illusion of the",
    "separate self what does that did Buddha",
    "think about himself not for an instant",
    "you know anyone that you think of as an",
    "enlightened being does not think about",
    "themselves for an instant the happiest",
    "people in life when people are their",
    "best is because uh they love something",
    "more than they love themselves they love",
    "their children they love God they love",
    "their mission what have you and all",
    "misery comes from rumination from",
    "sitting around being depressed going in",
    "circles in your own head about me me me",
    "me is a disease and uh you need the a",
    "concept of a me to be effective and to",
    "keep track of things you have a memory",
    "you have certain predictions your",
    "personality patterns but the more you",
    "self- obsessed the less happy you're",
    "going to be I guarantee you that and I'm",
    "not doing I'm not saying I don't think",
    "about myself to be happy I can't even",
    "tell you why I don't think about myself",
    "I think it just comes from having",
    "thought through a lot of things and then",
    "just I I get interested in topics and",
    "Concepts and ideas and understandings",
    "and the more that I sort of focus that",
    "way the less I just end up thinking",
    "about myself so even like you know",
    "people ask me like oh how's your day",
    "going I'm like I have no idea I don't",
    "think about it really yeah good maybe if",
    "I'm really tired I'll say okay I'm tired",
    "you know if something really bad",
    "happened like oh it wasn't a great day",
    "but most of the time I couldn't even",
    "tell you my own State of Mind okay cuz",
    "I'm not interested in it I don't think",
    "it's interesting it's interesting for us",
    "and I'll give you some perspective here",
    "yeah we were one of the first podcasts",
    "in India uh currently the biggest and I",
    "feel that's an outcome of constantly",
    "tearing apart people's chest getting",
    "into their hearts and getting to know",
    "them because in India we're emotional",
    "people and we want to know the emotions",
    "of others we want to know what's in",
    "other people's mind or it's dumb luck",
    "cuz you started early I'm just kidding",
    "or or that of course not I'm just joking",
    "with you luck is definitely a part of me",
    "I mean look luck favors are prepared uh",
    "Joe Rogan uh is incredibly successful",
    "because he was doing podcasting before",
    "his podcasting he was the top guy on",
    "Ustream which was just like a streaming",
    "thing on the internet before podcasting",
    "came along so uh there's a certain kind",
    "of person that it takes to be",
    "early you make your own luck in that",
    "sense I actually",
    "luck is luck is one of those things that",
    "you shouldn't believe in even if it's",
    "true because believing it will hurt your",
    "agency just like victim mentality right",
    "thinking you're a victim even if it's",
    "true don't believe it because it'll just",
    "hurt your agency because you have no",
    "power as a victim you have no power if",
    "things are up to luck uh whatever power",
    "you have in life comes from believing",
    "that you can change things and do things",
    "and even if you can't change the outside",
    "you can at least change the inside No",
    "One controls your mind but you um so",
    "yeah it's it's not luck I was jok",
    "talking the question I have for you is",
    "while all of us sit in India and view",
    "Naval ravikant ruling the internet in so",
    "many ways uh a lot of Indians feel very",
    "proud okay to see someone from India uh",
    "you know who shares genetics with us uh",
    "kind of kill it on a world stage uh so",
    "I've had this thought experiment lately",
    "as I've been researching for this",
    "episode I thought to myself that what if",
    "Noel's parents didn't leave India and",
    "what if he was in Delhi I'm pretty sure",
    "you'd still uh take up some form of",
    "Entrepreneurship knowing your",
    "personality because I think there's some",
    "traits that don't change uh but then",
    "there's a lot that changes because of",
    "geography I I wonder if you've ever",
    "thought of that reality if your parents",
    "didn't leave India uh and go to the US",
    "how would your life be different",
    "according to you I don't I don't want to",
    "downplay geography at all I actually",
    "think where you live is the single most",
    "important decision you make uh but the",
    "first part of that is making a decision",
    "uh I like to think that even if my",
    "parents had not immigrated to the US I",
    "would have probably done so at a later",
    "age because I was ambitious uh and I",
    "wanted to be around smart people and I",
    "wanted to build things uh when I",
    "immigrated to the US I was not in any",
    "position to go to Silicon Valley and",
    "build things I had to kind of you know",
    "claw my way there um and I got there a",
    "little later than I should have frankly",
    "but at any given time in the world's",
    "history there's usually only one or two",
    "places that really matter in terms of",
    "moving the world forward so there was a",
    "time when it was Athens in ancient",
    "Greece there's a time when it was",
    "Florence in Italy there's a time when it",
    "was uh London in the United Kingdom and",
    "the the time when I was kind of coming",
    "into my formative years it was Silicon",
    "Valley and I knew that I the first time",
    "I used an Apple computer it was an old",
    "Macintosh in uh the computer room in my",
    "high school I just fell in love with it",
    "and I and I just knew that I had to get",
    "closer to uh Apple that that was the",
    "thing that pulled me in when I got to",
    "Silicon Valley the first thing I did was",
    "with my bags I went in a taxi straight",
    "from the airport to app's headquarters",
    "and I wandered around um and I'd read",
    "this book by Guy Kawasaki called the",
    "Macintosh way that was very",
    "inspirational to me so at some point if",
    "you are if you have high agency if",
    "you're a person that's selfmotivated",
    "which I think almost everybody watching",
    "this is um you will end up where you're",
    "meant to go it's just going to take some",
    "effort the universe drops plenty of",
    "opportunity around you but it's not",
    "necessarily on your head and you have to",
    "walk over there and pick it up your",
    "podcast didn't build itself for example",
    "counterfactuals are impossible to do",
    "like uh yes if you had gone if you had",
    "immigrated to the US early you'd",
    "probably be doing a podcast in the US um",
    "or uh you know if you weren't born a",
    "podcaster you found your way to being a",
    "podcaster so even though yes there's",
    "luck involved there's counterfactuals",
    "involved there's immigration involved",
    "don't believe that stuff you know it's",
    "better to uh just kind of take",
    "responsibility both externally and",
    "internally externally for what you manag",
    "to do and internally for how you feel",
    "about it uh like one of my little tweets",
    "to myself and all the good ones are to",
    "myself was I and I alone am responsible",
    "for everything I think and feel um so",
    "for example if I get mad at somebody",
    "about something it's my fault why am I",
    "mad why am I making myself angry um why",
    "can't I just deal with the same",
    "situation in a cool calm and collected",
    "way why do I have to show to or not even",
    "show why do I have to lose control",
    "because anger is a loss of self-control",
    "why why am I still so broken inside that",
    "that happens so I I kind of reject this",
    "line of questioning to be honest you",
    "know what if what if what if who cares",
    "what if we're here um you know you",
    "constantly talk about that steel",
    "framework thing you say that learn the",
    "first principles yes um while we were at",
    "the event a lot of the people backstage",
    "were like ask navel about how he",
    "achieved this level of clarity and I",
    "understand that you focus on first",
    "principles thinking but what's",
    "underneath that thought like did you",
    "read a book at some point in life that",
    "pointed you towards it no no no no no I",
    "I think uh when I was young my dad",
    "wasn't around much and uh he was gone he",
    "had to he immigrated to the US before",
    "the rest of us did it took four years",
    "where he could pull us there and then my",
    "parents went through divorce and so on",
    "so one good thing was I never had",
    "anybody telling me what to do ever um",
    "and I had to figure everything out for",
    "myself and I think that helps a lot it",
    "makes you very high agency um I also",
    "nobody in my like my aunts and my mom",
    "they loved us to death but there was",
    "nobody saying this is right that's wrong",
    "do it this way don't do it that way so",
    "you figure it out for yourself and",
    "started with reading but eventually just",
    "goes to thinking but I don't think",
    "there's anything special I I think I",
    "think deep down everybody wants to",
    "understand things right everybody wants",
    "to learn everyone's curious all children",
    "are curious any young child they'll be",
    "asking questions all day long and I",
    "think the trick is just don't stop",
    "asking questions and keep asking",
    "questions until you can answer something",
    "your own",
    "satisfaction um maybe I had the luxury",
    "of the time to read you know that's",
    "helpful because it helps answer",
    "questions when you're younger at least",
    "some some reading a lot of too much",
    "reading or reading the wrong things can",
    "be bad too right because you can stuff",
    "your head with the wrong things I I I",
    "guess for for decades I did not feel",
    "like I was that smart because what would",
    "happen is I would talk to somebody and",
    "they'd say well there's this and that",
    "and there's this and they would just",
    "start using big terms and big words and",
    "defining huge things and and it took me",
    "a long time to figure out they didn't",
    "know what they were talking about if",
    "someone's using a lot of big words you",
    "know it's the mark of a charlatan to",
    "explain simple things in a complex way",
    "and uh it's a mark of a Genius Like",
    "Richard Fineman to to explain",
    "complicated things in simple ways the",
    "smartest people actually understand what",
    "they're talking about so they can",
    "explain it in plain English they don't",
    "need to resort to abstractions they",
    "don't need to impress and a lot of times",
    "with abstractions are leaky you poke at",
    "them and it doesn't quite map or it",
    "doesn't mean what what they think it",
    "means um I'd rather like stick and I'm a",
    "failed physicist I wanted to be a",
    "physicist so and my ma math wasn't good",
    "enough plus I wanted to make money so it",
    "didn't work out but uh I was surrounded",
    "by a lot of physicists and I read a lot",
    "of physics and so I felt dumb compared",
    "to the other physicists and so I I well",
    "I you're not going to trick a physicist",
    "you're not going to walk in and start",
    "talking physics and then suddenly like",
    "you you say something that's wrong",
    "they're going to call you on it physics",
    "is very rigorous and same thing with",
    "computer science which I did end up",
    "studying is the code has to compile the",
    "code has to run the code has to work you",
    "can't you can't trick the machine using",
    "words and so I think having a grounding",
    "in scientific disciplines around",
    "scientific people forces you to be",
    "rigorous and humble about your actual",
    "sphere of knowledge uh you can't Bluff",
    "people um systems in which you get",
    "feedback like real feedback uh free",
    "markets and nature right you can't trick",
    "nature I can't lie to Nature uh and I",
    "can't trick free markets all end up",
    "broke so these systems give you very",
    "good feedback and they force you into",
    "being rigorous um but it's very easy to",
    "trick people so if you're in politics if",
    "you're in law if you're in journalism if",
    "you're in media uh if you're just you",
    "know bsing with your friends it's very",
    "easy to trick people and then you get",
    "social rewards you don't get the",
    "negative feedback and that gets baked",
    "into your personality your identity your",
    "way of thinking uh so I think I was",
    "fortunate enough to be",
    "scientifically uh to get scientific",
    "feedback and to be pushed back upon",
    "through science and scientific people um",
    "also grew up in a tough environment so",
    "it was a no BS environment you had to be",
    "correct so you know when you're trying",
    "to survive you have to be correct uh",
    "when you have an abundance of resources",
    "and things are easy you don't have to be",
    "right because you there's cushions",
    "everywhere in the environment for you um",
    "so maybe I was forged that way but like",
    "I said I don't I don't introspect much I",
    "don't it doesn't really matter to me",
    "it's ancient history all that matters is",
    "here because this is all there is so",
    "let's talk about the Hein now yeah uh",
    "you're 50 now yeah has your definition",
    "of Love changed at all love is just it's",
    "one of these overloaded words it's like",
    "Freedom you know it means anything you",
    "want but what does love mean okay I I",
    "think so what is love",
    "okay this romantic love which we're all",
    "familiar with Bollywood thrives on that",
    "right that's that's an attachment thing",
    "it's like I love you if you love me",
    "let's go have kids together yes this a",
    "biological programming it's there it's",
    "important it's good to have that's not",
    "the real love or you love like a fanboy",
    "like how all of us love you yeah love",
    "love is a feeling of unity it's the it's",
    "the attraction to yourself actually it",
    "is seeing yourself in something else and",
    "then kind of wanting to complete with it",
    "um so you can have a spiritual love",
    "which is a love for Oneness or God you",
    "can have a love for your children",
    "because they're just part of you you can",
    "have a love for your community because",
    "it's it's like you you can have love for",
    "your ideas so love is attraction in that",
    "sense it's like a it's a positive",
    "attraction where you you see the unity",
    "in the thing with you and you don't",
    "necess want anything out of it and you",
    "know that's a that's a genuine love um",
    "the nice thing about love is if you",
    "think back in your life to when you were",
    "loved a lot right like you were loved by",
    "your parents great wonderful to be loved",
    "by your parents some point you took it",
    "for granted let's be honest we all take",
    "our parents for granted that's one of",
    "the things you learn as a parent",
    "yourself you're like oh my God my",
    "parents put up with all of this they",
    "were Saints right um You you really only",
    "start valuing your parents when you have",
    "your own children then you realize what",
    "a one-way relation relationship that",
    "love relationship and it's fine that's",
    "the way it's meant to be even your",
    "parents they want what's best for you",
    "they want you to love your kids not to",
    "love them back at the same level so uh",
    "one of the things you learn about love",
    "is okay when you're receiving love you",
    "take it for granted and it can even be a",
    "little too much like for example",
    "someone's attracted to you and you're",
    "not attracted to them you're like right",
    "the overzealous fan you know the girl",
    "the guy who's like chasing you around",
    "you're like I don't really know I don't",
    "I'm not really into this so that kind of",
    "love is the love that we think we want",
    "but we don't really I mean yes we want a",
    "little bit of it so we don't feel",
    "completely alone and and it makes us",
    "feel safe but it's not really the love",
    "that you want now think back to when you",
    "were in love when you're in love with an",
    "idea how you just work on it",
    "passionately when you're in love with",
    "let's say God or spirituality how you're",
    "just taken and you're you're you're",
    "swept away or when you're even in love",
    "with a person you're in love with a",
    "woman or your love with a man and all of",
    "a sudden everything is brighter and",
    "everyone's happier and you're just like",
    "walking on Cloud9 the feeling of being",
    "in love is greater than the feeling of",
    "being loved is my point okay and you can",
    "be in love anytime you want and how do",
    "you be in love well you can't be forced",
    "right you can't buy love you can't force",
    "love but I will say a commonality is",
    "generally the less you are thinking",
    "about yourself going back to what I was",
    "saying earlier the more you're going to",
    "be able to love other people and other",
    "things so for example the Buddhas uh you",
    "know I you know people will sometimes",
    "say well that's not a Buddha cuz that",
    "person is not loving enough well that's",
    "that's not necessarily true love is not",
    "a requirement for being a Buddha but it",
    "is an output of being a Buddha because a",
    "Buddha is a person who has seen through",
    "the illusion of the separate self uh and",
    "once they've seen through the illusion",
    "of the separate self they're no longer",
    "self- obsessed and therefore their love",
    "that was earlier turned inwards and",
    "became ego love for the self went",
    "outwards and it still flows uh as a very",
    "simple example you know here's something",
    "I uh uh is a little embarrassing but",
    "I'll be vulnerable you like vulnerable",
    "vulnerability right so I I I I kind of",
    "sometimes have these near-death",
    "exercises right where it's just like I",
    "imagine myself dying and it's not",
    "something that I do deliberately just",
    "kind of happens the the moments when you",
    "go into bed but before you fall asleep",
    "are really interesting because your mind",
    "goes into a really hazy almost",
    "psychedelic State and and I used to",
    "meditate a lot and somewhere along the",
    "way I just found that state between",
    "sleeping and waking to be really",
    "entertaining and entertaining",
    "entertaining yeah it's just entertaining",
    "so next time you're falling asleep just",
    "make a just just the smallest effort",
    "because if you make any real effort",
    "you'll fall you won't be able to sleep",
    "but make the smallest effort just to be",
    "aware of your thoughts as you're falling",
    "asleep as you're going to sleep and your",
    "thoughts start going wackier and wackier",
    "and wackier and they will just get wild",
    "like I'll have cats talking to me and",
    "you know just like weird stuff going in",
    "and out just it's like dreams you're",
    "you're basically lucid dreaming as",
    "you're falling asleep and they're the",
    "craziest dream they don't make any sense",
    "it's all nonsense You observe your own",
    "thoughts as you're about to fall asleep",
    "as I'm about to fall asleep that's when",
    "that's when your thoughts start going",
    "off the rails you stop thinking about",
    "like what am I doing tomorrow and how to",
    "work go today and you just start having",
    "these wacky random Connections in your",
    "head and it can be really fun to watch I",
    "was doing it just as an entertainment",
    "thing the an exploratory thing what have",
    "you found out I'm not looking to find",
    "anything so I think that's part of",
    "curiosity you have to be a little",
    "careful because if you go looking for",
    "something in particular then you're only",
    "open to seeing that thing and that's not",
    "how you find anything that's true um but",
    "it it's just pure mere curiosity it's",
    "it's an entertaining State that's that's",
    "a fine reason to do it right we do",
    "everything because we enjoy it at the",
    "end of the day if you didn't you",
    "wouldn't do it right or you want to not",
    "NE enjoy it but you do it because you",
    "want to um so I did it just because I",
    "wanted to and once in a while once in a",
    "while and I'm not trying to suggest",
    "anything because again if I suggest",
    "something then it's not going to happen",
    "for you but you know I'll basically feel",
    "like I'm dying so I'm falling asleep but",
    "I feel like I'm dying it's like you can",
    "see things fading out right and as you",
    "fall asleep the the French uh no that's",
    "not they call orgasm the petite more The",
    "Little Death right but uh but it's also",
    "because your mind shuts down right so",
    "what's happening is your your mind is",
    "shutting down from waking to sleeping",
    "State and that's kind of a death",
    "transition you can kind of feel like",
    "you're dying and you can literally see",
    "thoughts going offline your mind goes",
    "offline and as your mind goes offline",
    "pay atten attention to what",
    "remains pay attention to what actually",
    "remains and don't be afraid of it don't",
    "be AF you're just falling asleep but",
    "like I said sometimes it feels like",
    "you're dying and don't be afraid of",
    "death right you just kind of go with it",
    "it's what's just what's happening and",
    "then as your mind disappears as things",
    "disappear as things Fade Out of",
    "existence see what remains okay there's",
    "a version of something like this that I",
    "do for me the last two thoughts are",
    "always",
    "the girl I'm seeing and or uh the God I",
    "know MH which is just Universal energy",
    "yeah these are all manifestations of",
    "what you would call love right this is",
    "this is you stop thinking about yourself",
    "because thoughts are what Drive the",
    "self- obsession the self is ultimately",
    "just a thought it's a it's a the self is",
    "a thought that I am a separate creature",
    "I'm a body I'm a mind and if you truly",
    "were not thinking like you're in deep",
    "meditation or you're on a psychedelic or",
    "you're a Buddha you wouldn't have a",
    "thought of the self and you would just",
    "be you just be be aware that's all",
    "that's all there is I think the",
    "difference in your state of",
    "consciousness and mine is one you're",
    "much older and you've seen life and by",
    "older I mean brain older not physical",
    "body older you're a wiser human being",
    "and I think over the years you've just",
    "learned to observe and pick up data from",
    "everywhere U my early life experiences",
    "kind of catered me towards a deep sense",
    "of what we call bti in India which is uh",
    "nisat prame or unselfish love towards",
    "the Divine it's just an outcome of",
    "living in India in my eyes yeah no I I",
    "what matters is truth not who says what",
    "or what where you lived or what book you",
    "read what just matters is what's true",
    "and that you can figure out for yourself",
    "and you can figure it out just as well",
    "as me and you probably have your your",
    "core experience of of your awareness",
    "same as mine every emotion you felt I",
    "felt every emotion I felt you felt we're",
    "human no Human Experience is alien to us",
    "so we can have all the same feelings and",
    "thoughts just in different levels and",
    "different bases um i s i s I sort of",
    "reject this idea that I'm Wiser or more",
    "advanced I don't think that's true no if",
    "I was wise I'd be a Buddha I'm not so",
    "it's like you know two ants debating",
    "like you know who's smarter and there's",
    "like a there's like a human walking",
    "around over there right what ises it",
    "matter okay not in our eyes because for",
    "a lot of dudes in their 20s and 30s you",
    "are what we want to become especially",
    "from a peace perspective I'm the same",
    "guy I've always been and I wouldn't even",
    "say I'm that peaceful my mind is a wreck",
    "really yeah I'm always like my mind's",
    "always running all over the place it's",
    "it's it's always active you know how you",
    "said that happiness is peace and motion",
    "mhm uh that's something that stayed with",
    "me over the years and it's something I",
    "practiced the the person who's going to",
    "know the most about weight loss is the",
    "person who was fat as a kid the person",
    "who's going to know the most about peace",
    "and happiness is the one who was the",
    "most miserable inside so don't take from",
    "anything I write to say that I'm some",
    "peaceful Zen Buddha inside I'm not my",
    "mind still runs out of control it's I'm",
    "a crazy person I'm a I'm a crazy person",
    "who's trying to be a little less crazy",
    "and observing my own craziness that",
    "that's how I can come back to you and",
    "say like you know when I started",
    "tweeting a lot uh about anything other",
    "than technology so I I you know I was an",
    "investor in Twitter early on small",
    "investor in 2007 and Twitter really",
    "launched and started getting big around",
    "2010 not even big it was still small but",
    "I was active on Twitter from the start",
    "but around 2012 2013 I was going through",
    "a tough period and that's when I started",
    "tweeting uh the stuff that I was",
    "supposed to tweet and I you know I",
    "started getting feedback from people in",
    "the environment who were like hey that's",
    "weird you know you're like a VC you're",
    "like an entrepreneur people not going to",
    "trust you they think you're strange are",
    "you high you know that was like a",
    "constant uh thing and I was just like I",
    "I don't care I'm just writing to myself",
    "right and and I was writing down my",
    "crazier and crazier thoughts uh and I",
    "for a long time I got no positive",
    "feedback on it which is fine it's",
    "actually fine because if you if you're",
    "doing it for positive feedback you're",
    "eventually going to end up doing the",
    "right the wrong thing right I like",
    "burning my audience I like occasionally",
    "I'll tweet things that I don't",
    "completely believe that are a little",
    "incendiary because I want to find all",
    "the people who get easily triggered so I",
    "can block them uh I just want to blow",
    "them out I don't care about followers",
    "followers are worthless right if easy",
    "mechanism to adjust your friend list",
    "yeah if you're if you're if you're doing",
    "anything for followers your followers",
    "are worthless uh you know who would you",
    "have rather follow you 10 people that",
    "you respect that are intelligent and",
    "interesting and wise or like a million",
    "monkeys so the the follower count thing",
    "is utterly worthless and I don't even",
    "want followers I only want peer",
    "relationships um because follower is",
    "kind of a weird thing now this this",
    "person's not thinking for themselves and",
    "uh no what what every intelligent person",
    "craves is other intelligent people right",
    "to help things things through uh and to",
    "kind of bond with but um I don't know",
    "where I was going with this but yeah",
    "screw followers anyway yeah I was I was",
    "tweeting and I was tweeting like the",
    "craziness in my mind right I was I'm a",
    "crazy person",
    "and so I was just going through my own",
    "head and trying to sort out my own",
    "thoughts and it's a complete mess and uh",
    "it turns out that we all have the same",
    "internal thoughts and we all have the",
    "same internal experiences we all do we",
    "have them in different order maybe we",
    "interpret different things from them but",
    "we all have the same feelings so every",
    "time I put out some late night tweet",
    "with some crazy thought you know people",
    "around the world would just be like yeah",
    "I'm thinking that too um I forget who",
    "said this there was a great line that I",
    "read a long time ago but it was",
    "something like oh I think it was Emerson",
    "uh and he said uh you know in every",
    "genius we see our own ordinary thoughts",
    "but they come back to us with a certain",
    "alienated",
    "Majesty right so it's it's just the",
    "willingness to say it combined with",
    "saying it in an interesting way so what",
    "I realized was that what I liked about",
    "Twitter it was like an open Journal",
    "which forced me to craft my thoughts it",
    "would give me feedback obviously because",
    "people will come out and correct you",
    "even if you're correct",
    "and what I enjoyed writing was I liked",
    "saying things that I thought were true",
    "that were novel to me in that moment",
    "obviously anything I can think of",
    "somebody else has probably thought of",
    "with very few exceptions",
    "so it was something novel to me",
    "something that was true and I would say",
    "it in an interesting way so that I would",
    "remember it uh and because I read a lot",
    "as a kid I tried writing I wasn't I",
    "didn't have the patience to be a long",
    "form writer I wrote a few blog posts and",
    "never even wrote a book and uh I tried",
    "poetry um because I like reading poetry",
    "but I didn't care to learn meter and",
    "Rhythm and rhyme I just cared about the",
    "words and the and how evocative they",
    "were and so Twitter was a perfect medium",
    "for me it allowed me to be to use word",
    "selection and simple Framing and",
    "explanation to really hone down things",
    "that I thought to be true and were",
    "interesting to me and write them as",
    "notes to myself and to this day like",
    "every day I go on Twitter and someone's",
    "quote tweeted me on something or there's",
    "like some Nal bot that's like thrown up",
    "a noal quote and I look at them I'm like",
    "oh I should follow that advice damn that",
    "was good like that was written to me",
    "that's a note to sell from me from five",
    "years ago I should take my own advice",
    "it's kind of like you're growing up in",
    "front of the world yeah it's and we're",
    "all always growing up right we're all",
    "we're all always on this journey of",
    "self-discovery this single player game",
    "or we're alone inside but yet we're",
    "deeply interconnected because we're all",
    "having the same thoughts the same",
    "emotions the same experiences with maybe",
    "different interpretations often the same",
    "interpretations the great questions in",
    "life the meaning of life or you know",
    "what am I doing here or what should I do",
    "uh they all have paradoxical answers uh",
    "so for example you know does life have",
    "any meaning uh I could say no life is",
    "meaningless you you arrive with nothing",
    "you die nothing survives you you don't",
    "remember anything as far as you're",
    "concerned the moment you close your eyes",
    "at last time the entire universe",
    "disappears it's like a dream that never",
    "happened poof no meaning",
    "okay on the other hand I could say",
    "actually life has infinite meaning uh",
    "every moment is connected to every other",
    "moment you can this it's the only thing",
    "that actually exists uh you can ascribe",
    "complete and utter meaning to it right",
    "uh another question you ask is am I",
    "alone and yeah of course you're",
    "completely alone no one else knows your",
    "thoughts you're single point of",
    "awareness nobody else can have that same",
    "point of awareness and any two points",
    "are infinitely different in space on the",
    "other hand it could say no of course",
    "you're not alone the entire universe had",
    "to conspire to to bring you here at this",
    "moment it's all particle collisions from",
    "The Big Bang till now and then poof here",
    "you are and uh how can you and",
    "everything that you do is a function of",
    "your environment and your genes neither",
    "of which you selected so you're not",
    "alone you're just you're you're part of",
    "everything you're you're indispensable",
    "part of everything um so all of these",
    "great questions are paradoxical answers",
    "uh and that's one of the ways that you",
    "know you're dealing with one of the",
    "great questions uh and it turns out you",
    "know if you think it through the reason",
    "when when you see these par OES often",
    "what you'll find is that the question is",
    "being asked you know what is the meaning",
    "of life but then it's being answered at",
    "two different levels and one level is a",
    "level of the individual separate self",
    "which says oh the meaning is just what I",
    "ascribe to it um and then sometimes you",
    "answer it there's a slate of hand and",
    "you answer it the level of the universal",
    "self where you say well of course you",
    "know the meaning is the universe or the",
    "meaning is life itself um or like am I",
    "alone if you answer that at the",
    "individual level then the answer is yes",
    "if you answer at the universal level the",
    "answer is no so the paradoxical answers",
    "come from do you choose to take do you",
    "choose to adopt the Viewpoint of",
    "yourself as a separate person or do you",
    "take the Viewpoint of your spiritual",
    "self uh and we jump between those those",
    "contradictions very Loosely without",
    "paying attention and we end up with",
    "these paradoxical answers and we think",
    "the the question is not solvable but",
    "that's not entirely true it is solvable",
    "it's just which level are you speaking",
    "from so for example going back to the",
    "Buddha a Buddha not the Buddha but a",
    "Buddha any Buddha any enlightened person",
    "they don't have any sense of persistent",
    "separate self and so they're always",
    "answering at the universal level and in",
    "that sense they're freed of",
    "contradictions and I think the reason we",
    "admire those people is because we",
    "ourselves want to be freed of this",
    "internal contradiction uh Bor has had a",
    "great saying that uh in every human",
    "there is a sense that something infinite",
    "has been lost wow and uh I love that",
    "phrase uh because to me that's kind of",
    "if if I think about kind of what's going",
    "on here right I can't prove it so at the",
    "end of the day you should figure it out",
    "for yourself but I think what's going on",
    "here is that there is a universal self",
    "which is just raw awareness and that's",
    "all there is everything in your",
    "experience is awareness in my eyes based",
    "on what I've read and learned through",
    "the show uh I feel like Hinduism",
    "explores exactly this question what is",
    "the infinite s yeah H Hinduism gets",
    "closer than anybody else but any ISM",
    "isn't going to quite get you there cuz",
    "it's an individual thing you know the",
    "word Hinduism is not like by modern day",
    "Hindus we we refer to it as sanatan D",
    "which is like the Eternal fith yeah and",
    "what I like about Hinduism is that it",
    "lets kind of everybody find their own",
    "way and you can pick your God you can",
    "pick your path it's a buffet yeah it's a",
    "buffet and but it has to be because",
    "there are as many paths as there are",
    "people uh and because you create an",
    "individual story right there's kind of",
    "an awareness or a Consciousness",
    "everything that you experience",
    "experience is in this awareness it",
    "arises in the awareness it's probably",
    "made of awareness it's known by",
    "awareness so what else is there",
    "everything is intermediated through your",
    "awareness and then on top of that you",
    "layer your identity and your body and",
    "your problems and your issues and your",
    "achievements and your desires and then",
    "eventually you unlayer all of that and",
    "you lose that and you go back to this",
    "undifferentiated awareness which has",
    "kind of always been around it's",
    "hypothesis I don't know if it's true a",
    "lot of people say it you know um and I",
    "do read a lot of old Indian texts oh",
    "really yeah well like I I'm a fan of uh",
    "obviously everyone says bhagad Gita but",
    "I like the ashtavakra Gita if You' read",
    "that one uh that's yeah didn't expect",
    "you to say that no Ash vakar is amazing",
    "uh vista's yoga which has a lot of the",
    "Enlightenment stories uh Herman Hesh",
    "wrote that book sidartha which is kind",
    "of a fictionalized Buddha story um but",
    "you know then I've read you know Raja",
    "yoga and autobiography of Yogi and all",
    "that stuff Oso Krishna MTI blah blah",
    "blah Dello uh Michael if if it's I got",
    "into would call Enlightenment porn and I",
    "tracked down about a dozen of these",
    "people in real life and I interviewed",
    "them and I met them I spent time with",
    "them and I meditated and I did all that",
    "stuff but the conclusion I kind of came",
    "to is that you got to figure it out",
    "yourself all that stuff is inspirational",
    "but and uh you can only kind of do it if",
    "you want to like right now I'm on",
    "YouTube and I'm watching uh old Krishna",
    "myy talks I'm watch watching papa Muji",
    "Rupert spir uh ascendor random Youtube",
    "videos the guy has like 10 followers but",
    "he's enlightened the YouTube algorithm",
    "is really good it finds Enlighten good",
    "people if you just click around far",
    "enough um but obviously at some level",
    "I'm not fully serious about it because",
    "if I was serious about it I would be",
    "there but there is a greater truth out",
    "there again this is a bit of a",
    "compliment to you in my eyes um you're",
    "the definition of what a sanatani is in",
    "terms of exploration and collecting",
    "knowledge and then coming to a",
    "conclusion about life and the Divine",
    "yourself based on your own experiences",
    "and knowledge then using the shastras",
    "the ancient books as reference points so",
    "that's just how I I think we all want to",
    "know the truth and there's little truths",
    "and there's big truths and there's",
    "bigger truths and this is probably the",
    "biggest truth right and I did cheat I",
    "skipped to the end I looked at the",
    "answer uh might have been a mistake to",
    "be honest because the the point is not",
    "to earn a PhD in Enlightenment actually",
    "be enlightened right and so I don't know",
    "exactly how you get there there doesn't",
    "seem to be a copyable path but I'm still",
    "fascinated with it my mind is still",
    "circling the drain on it does the",
    "Mahabharat have any influence on your",
    "mind I don't remember remember too well",
    "I I think uh now this is where I'm going",
    "to just offend a lot of people but I",
    "think that's mostly historical uh thing",
    "obviously everything you know old Indian",
    "mythology has a lot of uh spirituality",
    "weaved into it but no it's not one that",
    "I've spent much time on okay it's more",
    "the philosophies like the ashaka Gita",
    "and all that yeah I love the ashaka Gita",
    "it's incredible the song of",
    "self-realization yeah when you're",
    "reading that stuff yeah is there a part",
    "of your DNA that feels stimulated being",
    "Indian you everyone keeps trying to nail",
    "me on this uh on being Indian",
    "it's it's it's it's a very brown person",
    "thing to do well I think I think we want",
    "a certain pride in being Indian right",
    "because it was stripped off because it",
    "was stripped off I think that's exactly",
    "right and I sort of reject that it was",
    "stripped off really in the sense that",
    "I'm just like hey I'm equally valid",
    "right I don't consider myself inferior",
    "to anyone I don't consider Superior to",
    "anyone so in that sense like don't let",
    "them strip you in the first place that",
    "you have to then go needing it fulfill",
    "it and and re really only the individual",
    "can can truly transcend only the",
    "individual can rise above whatever is",
    "facing them um so putting your faith in",
    "a group identity you're sort of Bound",
    "for disappointment I mean how many",
    "Indians are there it's over a billion",
    "right so there's going to be as many",
    "points of differentiation as their",
    "commonality it's not like all billion",
    "Indians link arm and March do the same",
    "thing we're not we're not ants um so at",
    "least I approach it more from an",
    "individual level I'm happy to be Indian",
    "I have no objections with it I think",
    "it's a rich culture uh and I think it's",
    "you know helped me a lot and half the",
    "books I read these days were written by",
    "Indians you know back in the day almost",
    "all the philosophy I read is Eastern",
    "philosophy um and the little bit of",
    "Western philosophy that I like uh",
    "schopenhauer and Emerson were incredibly",
    "and D they were incredibly influenced by",
    "Eastern philosophy they basically just",
    "cribed Eastern philosophy and they put",
    "it in western words right um because",
    "Eastern philosophy has the virtue of",
    "being correct it's true right right uh",
    "one side says well you know God has this",
    "shape this skin color this size lived at",
    "exactly this time and has exactly these",
    "rules like skeptical you know the other",
    "side says well you are the self that",
    "you're looking for it's all inside of",
    "you you have to figure it out for",
    "yourself and you know here are some",
    "practical steps that you can take",
    "towards self-realization that seems more",
    "you know that seems more correct um I",
    "think it's an outcome of just kind of",
    "being older like you had more time to",
    "contemplate I think anyone who is highly",
    "truth seeking will eventually find their",
    "way to Eastern",
    "philosophy uh because it has the virtue",
    "of being true just like Western science",
    "has the advantage of being true okay so",
    "Western physics so when people talk",
    "about like oh we're going to have",
    "indigenous math no 2 plus two has to",
    "equal four right okay we could be wrong",
    "but I doubt it that's our best theory",
    "right now that 2 plus 2 equals 4 so I",
    "Look to Western for science technology",
    "advancement by the way the East is now",
    "starting to make strides there as well",
    "um but when it comes to the oldest",
    "questions the best answers are the",
    "oldest ones like the these some of a lot",
    "of what we've been discussing has been",
    "around us questions since the dawn of",
    "mankind so and Indian civilization is",
    "one of the oldest civilizations it's",
    "probably the oldest large civilization",
    "that explored these topics where we have",
    "written materials and records and",
    "practitioners and so on um and there's",
    "probably more Buddhas and alive on the",
    "Indian subcontinent than there are",
    "anywhere else in the world so if you're",
    "attracted to the truth of the old",
    "questions and you want to find the old",
    "answers you're going to head there this",
    "is natural I think there are some",
    "problems with traveling in India uh",
    "namely hygiene and it's a little chaotic",
    "but if one is ever seeking for the right",
    "answers in life especially when it comes",
    "to these questions India opens up",
    "certain portals in your head it can be",
    "influential that said if if you can't",
    "figure something like that out exactly",
    "where you are exactly when you are there",
    "then it's not true the truth is not",
    "something that's going to live in a",
    "certain region at a certain place at a",
    "certain time and has to be told to you",
    "by a certain person a certain way that's",
    "not a truth that's just another",
    "experience uh so anything that because",
    "the whole point of spirituality is to be",
    "freed of the monkey mind and to be at",
    "peace in the moment and so it can't be",
    "reliant on anything outside it can't be",
    "it can't it can't be in the future it",
    "can't be in a different place uh you",
    "know one of my problems that I have with",
    "all religions is this idea that like oh",
    "this is the word of God and it was p",
    "down through this book well okay well",
    "what if I didn't speak that language",
    "what if I was born at the wrong time no",
    "any fundamental truth that spiritual has",
    "to be accessible to every human at every",
    "time in every place regardless of",
    "language culture religion age you know",
    "gender whatever or even physical being",
    "like you could be you could have mental",
    "retardation you could be crippled you",
    "could be dying you should still be able",
    "to see and find and experience that same",
    "truth on your own otherwise if it's if",
    "it's brought to you from the outside if",
    "it's temporal it can be taken away from",
    "you and so I think the best path towards",
    "truth is understanding because when you",
    "deeply understand something um you're",
    "not going to unand it it's the nature of",
    "truth that once you see it once you",
    "learn it you don't unlearn it because",
    "it's true that's truth is indestructible",
    "knowledge in your mind uh it can only be",
    "replaced by a better truth it can only",
    "be replaced by oh okay that was that",
    "truth wasn't complete here's another",
    "piece of the truth that I was missing um",
    "but in that sense truth cannot be",
    "destroyed it can only be overruled by",
    "other truths so if you find uh some",
    "understanding then that can be with you",
    "forever has marriage brought further",
    "understanding when it comes to",
    "life I I don't marriage is fine",
    "household is great I don't like to",
    "discuss personal life okay I just don't",
    "think it as relevant to other people's",
    "lives I I will say like uh you know I",
    "was talking about this earlier today but",
    "my own favorite tweet uh to myself is",
    "the you know a Fit Body a calm mind and",
    "a house full of love these things cannot",
    "be bought they must be earned uh and",
    "house full of love is is that part and",
    "you can create a house full of love",
    "anytime you want by giving love uh that",
    "said you know marriage is complicated",
    "it's a negotiation uh between people you",
    "have to learn how to live together you",
    "have kids it's not easy uh but I'm not",
    "the person to give marital advice if",
    "only you will agree",
    "with it's it's too personal and every",
    "marriage is so unique and even the",
    "concept of marriage is sort of going",
    "away in a lot of Western societies uh uh",
    "I do encourage children I think children",
    "are amazing",
    "everyone should have kids yeah",
    "absolutely I don't understand this",
    "anti-natalist thing we here you're here",
    "I'm here because an unbroken chain of",
    "our ancestors from tadpoles to monkeys",
    "to now uh you know had children are you",
    "going to be the first ones to miss that",
    "Branch I mean if you believe in some",
    "afterlife all your ancestors looking",
    "down you're saying oh my God I can't",
    "believe it we struggle so hard you know",
    "we fought Tigers we we we cross",
    "mountains we we froze during the ice",
    "ages and this idiot just decided not to",
    "have children cuz he couldn't be",
    "bothered",
    "for bad guy to stop this CH yeah he's",
    "screwed up right but I will tell you",
    "like if if you are older in life and you",
    "don't have the Next Generation to look",
    "forward to then you better find God fast",
    "because I don't think like your own mind",
    "and your own life will be kind to you as",
    "you get",
    "older you know what I've learned about",
    "marriage M from the outside I'm not",
    "married yet but this is conjectural okay",
    "uh I think one's wife is always right",
    "and and that's the rule one should",
    "follow yeah see I reject that completely",
    "uh yeah people say like happy wife happy",
    "life that's all propaganda that's all",
    "feminine propaganda you're being",
    "brainwashed no both people have to be",
    "equally happy uh the secret to a happy",
    "relationship is two happy people and uh",
    "you can't be happier than your spouse so",
    "it's not happy wife happy life it's",
    "unhappy wife unhappy life you know so so",
    "you both have to be happy both of you",
    "have to work hard to make each other",
    "happy um you have to be a good fit and a",
    "good match but the point of getting",
    "married is to have children so so you",
    "know have the kids and then you know",
    "worst case you have kids which is still",
    "an amazing outcome and best case you're",
    "happily married and you have kids but I",
    "would I don't buy the you know keep the",
    "wife happy propaganda that's that's",
    "that's that's letting her Sher her",
    "duties it's been kind it's kind of you",
    "now that that approach would work if I",
    "asked your fiance or girlfriend and she",
    "said Oh My Philosophy is like uh you",
    "know keep the husband happy at all cost",
    "if she said that then I would be like",
    "okay that's a good match they're both",
    "trying to keep each other happy but if",
    "it's all one-sided no that doesn't work",
    "yeah I mean personally I'm very sanatani",
    "yeah and sanatan D says the key to a",
    "happy relationship is um tolerance and",
    "selfless service so those are the two",
    "kind of flag Poes I've got uh after",
    "finding the right that's good if",
    "everybody follows it uh you know if both",
    "people are selfless and tolerant with",
    "each other then it'll work out well but",
    "you're not going to be in any voluntary",
    "relationship where you're selfless and",
    "tolerant the other person's intolerant",
    "and selfish it won't last so you can",
    "only",
    "make those kind so those are good",
    "guidelines for society they're not",
    "necessarily good guidelines for the",
    "individual uh as an individual mate",
    "selection is a real thing you have to",
    "pick a person who you're incredibly",
    "compatible with uh you know the",
    "traditional model is that the you know",
    "the man earns and creates and the woman",
    "uh kind of takes care of the household",
    "the man takes care of things outside she",
    "takes care of things inside that's a",
    "traditional model I know in the west",
    "it's falling out of favor but it works",
    "and in that model the man has to be",
    "capable and do his duty and the woman",
    "has to be kind and love loving and you",
    "know take care of the household and so",
    "that is a valid model of how the world",
    "works and you can kind of I don't know",
    "sonan or whatever you can have some",
    "prescriptions about how to run that but",
    "the reality is life is very complicated",
    "every every individual is completely",
    "unique the combinatorics of human DNA",
    "are staggering you'll never meet two",
    "people who are even vaguely alike if you",
    "leave a friend you break up with a",
    "girlfriend you lose a person in your",
    "life a loved one you're never going to",
    "find a substitute you're never going to",
    "find anybody who's like the same or even",
    "close even close right I've never met",
    "two human beings who are even vaguely",
    "similar um except perhaps identical",
    "twins but that's theoretical I don't",
    "know any up close that well so if every",
    "person is unique just imagine how unique",
    "every relationship is so having other",
    "people navigate your relationship with",
    "hard and fast rules doesn't work you can",
    "look to it for inspiration you can look",
    "to it for principles but each",
    "relationship has to work on its own",
    "merits and I am I am a lazy person and I",
    "hate conflict so my rule is if a",
    "relationship has conflict I just leave",
    "it I don't fight with people if somebody",
    "wants to fight with me we get one fight",
    "and then it's over because there's a lot",
    "of people out there there's a lot of",
    "people out there and life is long so you",
    "have to navigate your way towards the",
    "people who love you for who you are and",
    "you love them the way they are nobody",
    "needs anybody to change and if they",
    "change it's okay because you still kind",
    "of value the core and you change",
    "together um the same way like you find",
    "you have to navigate your way to the",
    "career the job the profession the",
    "obsession where you like the thing for",
    "what it is the the moment is complete in",
    "of itself as you perform that act and if",
    "you get some reward out of it that's",
    "fantastic but that's not the core reason",
    "you do it um and the same way U I think",
    "you can apply that to every facet of",
    "your life even if you're eating you want",
    "to find the healthy food that you",
    "actually enjoy eating there's many",
    "healthy foods out there just find the",
    "ones that you enjoy eating and just",
    "focus down on those uh for exercise find",
    "the sport or the hobby where you it",
    "doesn't feel like work to you like play",
    "tennis or you know if you like running",
    "then go run if you like lifting then go",
    "lift if you like playing tennis then go",
    "play tennis so I think uh the the beauty",
    "of Modern Life is it gives us so many",
    "options uh and that's not a bad thing",
    "options are good uh it's just you have",
    "to navigate your way through the options",
    "and find out what works for you and then",
    "commit to that and so on relationships I",
    "don't view uh and I know this is uh",
    "antithetical to the classical Indian way",
    "of arranged marriage which had its",
    "merits that was basically saying hey",
    "let's find someone who's culturally",
    "similar socioeconomically similar uh you",
    "know worthy of you and the purpose of",
    "marriage is to build a household and",
    "have children so we'll take care of the",
    "basics didn't always work but you know",
    "pretty good hit rate compared to Modern",
    "where it's just like I'm going to marry",
    "my high school sweetheart or I'll roll",
    "the dice or oh I got this girl pregnant",
    "accidentally and then off we go so it",
    "can work better than some models but in",
    "a choice-based model which is where",
    "Western Society is and I think",
    "increasingly Eastern Society is there um",
    "you have to be picky uh so if you're",
    "having to sacrifice for your SP spouse",
    "and they're not sacrificing in return",
    "just go somewhere else if you're in",
    "constant conflict then both of you need",
    "to go find someone who's you're not each",
    "of you is not going to be in constant",
    "conflict with and I think that's a much",
    "better recipe that that ability to",
    "search and to look uh and to cut your",
    "losses quickly uh because there's High",
    "sunk cost in these relationships the the",
    "biggest problem in relationships is",
    "dishonesty where we're trying to make",
    "the other person happy we're trying to",
    "appear our best and so for the first",
    "year of the relationship you just fake",
    "it you just you're just a different",
    "person and sometimes that's just your",
    "emotions are driving you and you're in",
    "love so you're being on your best",
    "behavior without even thinking about it",
    "and sometimes it's a little more",
    "deliberate but the reality is the longer",
    "you fake it the worse it's going to be",
    "because then you get trapped and now",
    "it's sunk cost and you don't want to",
    "walk away and breaking that relationship",
    "is hard and your friends and family",
    "expect you together and you can't",
    "imagine life separately uh and now",
    "you're stuck uh so it's just better to",
    "be brutally honest upfront about who you",
    "are and your needs and your worst sides",
    "and and all of that and don't try to",
    "throw off any Impressions because if",
    "eventually this person will see you at",
    "your worst and eventually you will see",
    "them at their worst um so you might as",
    "well just start there you know from the",
    "outside looking in I personally have",
    "this impression of Naval rikan the brand",
    "and the human and I feel like nothing",
    "hurts that guy does anything hurt you at",
    "all uh you know I'm a very paranoid",
    "person uh so I do stress out about uh",
    "you know um I I grew up with very little",
    "so I'm always stressed stressing over",
    "like like politicians and money you know",
    "like the West has now come become very",
    "fashionable to hate money to hate wealth",
    "to hate entrepreneurs to try to tear",
    "people down uh We've turned into cancel",
    "culture right so yeah so you know those",
    "kinds of things occasionally stress me",
    "out um but I would say",
    "that",
    "um there's there's not anything I",
    "want right need is the need is the",
    "ultimate monkey other than knowledge",
    "right I have not even that like what is",
    "knowledge going to do for me I'm going",
    "to die it's all going to go to zero",
    "anyway so it's fun I enjoy learning",
    "things I love the aha moment when I",
    "connect something together and I would",
    "tweak it a little bit I would say it's",
    "understanding not knowledge knowledge is",
    "because knowledge gets conflated with",
    "memorization and you know memorizing",
    "facts and I got chat GPT for that and",
    "the internet um so I enjoy understanding",
    "I enjoy learning",
    "um my my own tweet to myself on this was",
    "spend your life in the company of",
    "geniuses sages children and books",
    "right those are the four things that I",
    "enjoy the most and there's a fifth thing",
    "a great Indian",
    "podcaster I thought you were going to",
    "say you're wife or a woman uh she's",
    "gonna she's gonna nail you on this one",
    "um I I think uh not there was there was",
    "an old thing a story that I was liked",
    "about Socrates where they took him into",
    "um they took him into the quent of the",
    "mall the market and there were all these",
    "luxuries and fineries and and things",
    "laid out and and Delicacies to eat and",
    "he",
    "said there are so many things in this",
    "world that I do not want and I was like",
    "oh that's power that's that's it right",
    "there right or when Alexander the Great",
    "met diogenes uh who was living in a",
    "barrel uh you know Alexander was like I",
    "wish if I came back in their life that I",
    "could be like diogenes and diynes said",
    "something along the lines so well if I",
    "came back I wouldn't want to be",
    "Alexander right so being freed from need",
    "is the ultimate but I'm not I'm not a",
    "Buddha I'm not the guy who's going to",
    "suddenly renounce everything and not",
    "have a need uh and renunciation doesn't",
    "work anyway uh but it's more that you",
    "know I like games I think we all like",
    "games we all play games we play the",
    "social game we play the video games we",
    "play the money games we play the fitness",
    "game we play The Fame game we play the",
    "love game we play the happiness game we",
    "all play",
    "games and I've played a lot of games my",
    "whole life of every kind and I've won a",
    "lot of games and the reason to win the",
    "game is so you can be done with it so",
    "you can see through it if you just keep",
    "playing the same game over and over and",
    "over grinding you know trying to go",
    "higher and higher and higher maybe that",
    "works for somebody it doesn't work for",
    "me so I like to either see through games",
    "or I like to be done with them so I used",
    "to be an avid video gamer until very",
    "recently actually this a couple of years",
    "back maybe like five years ago I",
    "probably spent more time playing video",
    "games than I spent working did it do",
    "anything for your mind it was fun uh",
    "yeah probably I mean it was I was",
    "playing harder than harder games and",
    "more and more intellectual games and",
    "strategy games and War games and",
    "thinking games but they're just games",
    "they're meaningless games right what was",
    "your favorite there were so many I mean",
    "mostly war games I was a I was a deep",
    "war game magic the Gathering if you",
    "remember that game you know so",
    "anyway theic game doesn't matter the",
    "point is I would just play lots and lots",
    "of games and at some deep deep level I",
    "knew they were worthless because you",
    "know you're playing this game and then",
    "you get some stupid reward at the end",
    "and then they change the rules of that",
    "game and then the game changes in like",
    "your your reset or like you you forgot",
    "your login or you lost it cuz you",
    "upgraded your computer or your whatever",
    "or this they rolled out version five",
    "against a version four you're starting",
    "all over right so you know it's",
    "worthless you're just running in a",
    "circle right and all games are worthless",
    "because you die in the end but at least",
    "some are longer live than others right",
    "there are games that like for example if",
    "I'm playing the wealth creation game I",
    "can make money which has an actual",
    "effect on my remaining life as opposed",
    "to just playing a video game which has",
    "none of that benefit",
    "I'm not taking away from games games are",
    "useful uh they're they're training for",
    "the intellectual athlete just like",
    "sports might be training for War for the",
    "physical athlete um that",
    "said I was still playing a lot of games",
    "I knew they were kind of worthless I was",
    "doing it to blow off steam or just",
    "because I don't even need a reason I was",
    "it was entertaining um but then one day",
    "I read a blog post and uh you know truth",
    "is that when you see it you can't unsee",
    "it and this guy in just the right turn",
    "of phrase he called games a shadow",
    "career he said games are a shadow career",
    "and I was like oh that's so good that is",
    "so good it's like a career that you're",
    "building that's fake you know it's a",
    "shadow it's just going to disappear I",
    "was like and and since that moment I",
    "haven't been able to see games as",
    "anything other than a waste of time so I",
    "still do play games occasionally so once",
    "in a blue moon mostly with my kid I'll",
    "pick up a game I'll play for a little",
    "bit but now I'm thoroughly in completely",
    "aware that it is a quote unquote waste",
    "of a time and if I'm okay wasting the",
    "time it's fine but these days I'm not",
    "really okay wasting time you still play",
    "war games with your kid uh I'm going to",
    "pick one or two up uh mostly these days",
    "though they're on their iPads playing",
    "their own games it's fine but what what",
    "game would you have your kid play and I",
    "asked this from the perspective of I",
    "feel when I was growing up as a teenager",
    "few games that really affected my",
    "mindset in life FIFA uh like the",
    "football game because it just teaches",
    "you something about team play uh Age of",
    "Empires obviously because you learn",
    "strategy Sim City because you learn",
    "Administration and Sims because you",
    "learn about self",
    "I mean look I I can argue for many of",
    "them I can argue for The Sims and the",
    "civilization type games I can argue for",
    "board games war games uh strategy games",
    "um the reality is even the few games I",
    "play these days they're just like",
    "runners or Jumpers or Fighters you know",
    "they don't have any real meaning to them",
    "it's fine",
    "there's I think one of the one of my",
    "tweets or analogies that went more viral",
    "than others was like I really believe",
    "that you should live your life like an",
    "athlete or like a lion right which means",
    "that most of your time you're resting",
    "you're just fussing around uh you're",
    "lazing around you're just doing whatever",
    "you find entertaining and then once in a",
    "while you get obsessed with something",
    "and something is important and you just",
    "pour everything into it so I would",
    "rather be recharged and ready for my",
    "next intellectual or physical Obsession",
    "than putting myself on the grinder of I",
    "have to wake up at this time then eat my",
    "blueberries and then do my push-ups and",
    "and just like live a regimented",
    "mechanical life uh I want to live a very",
    "free life I don't want a calendar I",
    "don't want have to be in a specific",
    "place at a specific time I don't want",
    "have to answer to people um I just want",
    "to be free and I think that's how you do",
    "your best work and especially in an age",
    "where we have so much leverage in the",
    "system either through code or Media or",
    "through other people or through Capital",
    "the quality of your decision- making",
    "dominates everything um Warren Buffett",
    "is one of the richest men in the world",
    "just because he makes a right decision",
    "once a year and so having a clear mind",
    "is way more important than anything else",
    "which and this is all exuse for",
    "laziness which just lets me relax and",
    "relax and relax until I need to make",
    "that decision but it's like even if I",
    "look at my you know",
    "um uh you know having made money in life",
    "has happened through a bunch of",
    "different sources but the number one was",
    "like way bigger than the number two",
    "through end put together two number two",
    "was bigger than three through nend put",
    "together three was bigger than four",
    "through nend put together and that's",
    "kind of how your entire life Works what",
    "was number one if you don't mind me I'm",
    "not going to get into it but it's uh but",
    "it it's it the compound interest applies",
    "in all intellectual and often even in",
    "relationship domains uh so for example",
    "your number one relationship in your",
    "life eventually your kids currently your",
    "wife maybe one of your parents is going",
    "to be more valuable to you than kind of",
    "all the rest put together right there so",
    "maybe not so much in relationships but",
    "definitely in definitely in uh learning",
    "you know your best ideas is going to be",
    "worth more than all the rest my best",
    "Tweets the few best Tweets you know",
    "you're only judging your best work not",
    "your worst so in that sense being high",
    "output is really good current generation",
    "May judge you on your average but the",
    "future what'll happen is let's say you",
    "record I don't know how many podcasts",
    "have you recorded 800 800 great so you",
    "know by the time you're done you'll",
    "probably have 2,000 or something before",
    "you're finally like okay I'm bored of",
    "this game right so let's say you have",
    "2,000 podcasts in your life what's going",
    "to happen is 20 of them are going to be",
    "amazing okay and those will stand the",
    "test of time and they'll slowly trickle",
    "down trickle down trickle down 100 years",
    "from now people will be watching 20 of",
    "them and then 200 years from now 300",
    "years from now they'll be watching one",
    "of them right so it's you so in all of",
    "these intellectual domains you are only",
    "judged by your best work in posterity",
    "which is not to say you can just",
    "shortcut to it but most effort in life",
    "in that sense is wasted but it's both",
    "training wheels for the winning one plus",
    "you just never know when or where the",
    "right thing is going to emerge so you",
    "kind of just have to keep moving um but",
    "I I the thing I'm not a fan of is",
    "wasting time wasting time you know",
    "tedious meetings with tedious people uh",
    "you know traveling to places for for",
    "business where there's like you don't",
    "actually enjoy it um anything ceremonial",
    "or ritual meetings you know complete",
    "with of time most meetings uh just save",
    "your time save your energy um just be",
    "happy enjoy yourself and be and be ready",
    "for the opportunity because there there",
    "a time when opportunity comes and if you",
    "yourself are rested and ready and you",
    "find yourself interested in it then you",
    "have the space in your life and in your",
    "mind that you can be sucked into it um",
    "and again without any uh desire for a",
    "specific outcome because when you desire",
    "for a specific outcome you're moving",
    "away from truth seeking because now",
    "you're looking for something and if that",
    "thing turns out not to be true you're",
    "going to try and force it and we can't",
    "help it we're Desiring creatures you",
    "wouldn't even be here on this Earth if",
    "you weren't a Desiring creature right",
    "you just lie there in the dirt and let",
    "worms eat you so you are a Desiring",
    "creature but you just have to be careful",
    "with your desires because they will take",
    "you away from your truth because uh true",
    "true reasoning is UN motivated it's or",
    "it's motivated purely by curiosity",
    "curiosity just means you want to know",
    "the truth that's all it is so in that",
    "sense curiosity is the pure Mo",
    "motivation every other motivation is",
    "motivated reasoning and leads you to is",
    "more likely to lead you to an incorrect",
    "answer and then the worst thing you can",
    "do is get through motivated reasoning",
    "get to the falsehood and then you bake",
    "that into your identity you identify it",
    "with yourself you say well because I'm a",
    "Hindu or I'm a Christian or I believe",
    "this or because I'm a Republican or",
    "Democrat I believe this and then you get",
    "locked into that now that is a part of",
    "your understanding it's a shaky",
    "foundation and then you start attaching",
    "other things to that shaky Foundation",
    "politics is a good example of this well",
    "you know because I you know believe in",
    "uh women's right for abortion now I also",
    "have to believe that you know trans",
    "women or men or men or women and I have",
    "to believe that like you know there's no",
    "heritability in certain things but there",
    "is in other things I have to believe",
    "that capitalism is evil you start",
    "plugging all these things together that",
    "don't actually belong together they're",
    "voting coalitions they're coalitions of",
    "Voters that have assemble single issue",
    "voters but now all of a sudden you have",
    "to adopt all of these beliefs or in",
    "Christian you know if I'm Christian then",
    "I have to believe this and this and this",
    "otherwise I'm not a true Christian I",
    "have to believe this and this Hindu sect",
    "otherwise not a true Hindu all that is",
    "nonsense one of the best lines I heard",
    "on this was Buddha wasn't a Buddhist you",
    "know so all the people that you admire",
    "all the people that you look up to",
    "they're they're not they don't strongly",
    "self-identify with any movement you know",
    "lean you created Singapore where we're",
    "sitting today he didn't consider himself",
    "Singaporean right he created that thing",
    "so I think uh all of us are meant to not",
    "okay not nobody's meant to do anything",
    "but all of us function at our best when",
    "we don't identify with anything outside",
    "of",
    "ourselves the one thing that this",
    "conversation is teaching me is that uh",
    "the universe is kind of wired to us",
    "up a little",
    "bit well it would have to be to be",
    "interesting right if you could just if",
    "it was predictable it' be boring there",
    "be no point in being here is this the",
    "most most unserious podcast that you've",
    "ever done I don't",
    "know probably maybe I don't know are you",
    "comfortable being unserious sure yeah",
    "I'm comfortable being me I mean I was so",
    "intimidated by the thought of speaking",
    "to you but once I got talking to you uh",
    "I've just realized that you're like any",
    "of us you've just done the right things",
    "consistently and you've done the things",
    "that you felt were easy but made a habit",
    "out of a few other difficult things I",
    "think if there's one thing that my",
    "friends would say is that like I try to",
    "figure everything out for myself I don't",
    "listen to anybody else not even your",
    "wife",
    "nobody your kid nobody really yeah no",
    "gurus no mentors no teachers no holy",
    "this or that I mean I I definitely have",
    "learned from people for sure I've almost",
    "everything I know I've learned from",
    "other people but I verified it for",
    "myself is your work your Guru my work",
    "work I don't",
    "work you you know how you have that",
    "saying about you choose something that",
    "feels like play to you but work for",
    "others oh yeah yeah yeah and I think",
    "once you advance in that journey of play",
    "it turns into art after a point and",
    "that's how you look at all the products",
    "that you invest in that they art for you",
    "do they teach you things for life okay",
    "whether it's in politics science",
    "business spirituality whatever history",
    "remembers the artists the artists are",
    "the people who are creative and March to",
    "their own beat and do their own thing um",
    "great software is Art great business is",
    "Art starting even like starting a new",
    "country you know some level is Art",
    "you're creating x n Hilo you're creating",
    "something out of nothing um and uh that",
    "to me is like the most rewarding thing",
    "to be doing at any given time but art",
    "can't be forced uh it can't in a sense",
    "art is done for its own sake it's not",
    "done for any external purpose if you're",
    "doing it for money it's less you're",
    "you're hurting it's uh it's cap ility to",
    "be Arts not to say it can't still be",
    "great art but you're just you're now",
    "beholden to other interests it's like",
    "motivated reasoning it's like true",
    "scientists try to figure things out to",
    "fulfill their desire to figure things",
    "out right and the moment they figure it",
    "out it's complete they don't need a",
    "Nobel Prize or a Fields medal afterwards",
    "and in fact some of the better ones have",
    "rejected that or like uh famously Bob",
    "Dylan I think rejected the pz or Prize",
    "or whatever it was like he got some",
    "massive prize didn't even show up didn't",
    "even bother cuz he knows his music is",
    "good he created for himself so I I do",
    "think that is the highest calling",
    "creating something for yourself because",
    "you want to exist now nobody's perfect",
    "we're not all going to get there um and",
    "there's always going to be external",
    "motivations but the less the more",
    "internally motivated you can be the more",
    "the thing itself is the reward um the",
    "better the work you will do um and uh",
    "the more F fulfilling it it is so that's",
    "kind of what I aim for okay but maybe",
    "that's just my excuse for being useless",
    "these days okay",
    "um you know again everyone views the",
    "world with the lens that their own mind",
    "has placed due to their own stories MH",
    "so the lens I view the world with is",
    "honestly pretty spiritual and I know you",
    "don't like the word but again it's an",
    "outcome of growing up in India in my",
    "eyes um there's a concept of the flow",
    "state state of flow where your best work",
    "happens and I've always wondered to",
    "myself about your Flow State nal's Flow",
    "State and for me at least based on",
    "what's visible to the public eye it",
    "happens when you're TW eting when you're",
    "in one of your speet storms and it",
    "happens when someone's asking you the",
    "right questions and unlocking things am",
    "I right in like yeah I mean in a flow",
    "State your mind isn't uh obsessing with",
    "itself it's you're not thinking about",
    "yourself you're focused on the thing",
    "you're focused on the activity uh it's a",
    "meditative State it's it's a state where",
    "like for example if you're drawing or",
    "painting then you are the brush you are",
    "the paint you're only thinking about",
    "that and there is no internal chatter",
    "you're not saying oh man you know can't",
    "wait for dinner or I can't believe my",
    "wife said this to me that that's all",
    "gone and that's and you're also",
    "operating at the edge of your capability",
    "so it's interesting enough that you you",
    "are being stressed you're being strained",
    "you know you're operating at the edge",
    "but it's not so far forward that you are",
    "being confused or you're like obviously",
    "screwing up um so flow state is a",
    "wonderful thing it's it's a very",
    "meditative State",
    "um but probably the the shortest way to",
    "not be in a flow state is to try to be",
    "in a flow state right because it's again",
    "it's that effort right so it comes much",
    "more from you find things that you like",
    "to do and then when you and because you",
    "like to do something you're interested",
    "in it you're going to get good at it",
    "you're going to be doing it and as",
    "you're doing it you're climbing that",
    "ladder of uh of Mastery and any you can",
    "climb that ladder in literally anything",
    "um as you get more and more into it um",
    "you're going to be more and more in flow",
    "uh I my problem is I switch around a lot",
    "so I fall in love with something I",
    "obsess over it I learn everything I",
    "possibly can about it over a couple of",
    "months kind of period and then once I",
    "figure the basics out 8020 I start",
    "getting bored and then when I start",
    "getting bored I just sort of background",
    "it I becomes a piece of my knowledge and",
    "understanding and then I just move on to",
    "the next thing or I just spend time",
    "being bored until the next thing comes",
    "along do you think that the Flow State",
    "sometimes allows you to channelize",
    "knowledge",
    "that's present",
    "externally I don't know what I'm going",
    "to say until I say it so it's kind of",
    "funny that one of the ways that I learn",
    "what I think is by saying it and the",
    "same way one of the ways that I learn",
    "what I know is by tweeting it so very",
    "often I'll just be talking with a friend",
    "I'll be hanging out I'll be having",
    "dinner or I'll be sitting at home by",
    "myself late at night and I'll just have",
    "a thought and I'll come into my mind",
    "almost fully baked and I'm like oh I",
    "should tweet that and then I'll tweet it",
    "and then sometimes I have a second",
    "thought I better changed this and",
    "usually the first version is always the",
    "best uh I don't know where it comes from",
    "it's kind of interesting it comes from",
    "Beyond whatever that means right maybe",
    "it comes from the depths of my mind",
    "maybe comes from somewhere else but they",
    "come to me fully formed which is kind of",
    "the entertaining thing I mean I'm of the",
    "belief that it comes from somewhere",
    "else creativity is a mysterious Force",
    "right yeah I don't know I mean that's",
    "again I keep bringing this up man but",
    "when I'm talking to you I feel like I'm",
    "talking to Rishi you know Rishi is so uh",
    "kind of embarrassing sorry",
    "but that's that's what it feels like so",
    "you know on a very Primal level the",
    "podcast for me is based on my childhood",
    "dream of wanting to explore the",
    "Himalayas and have conversations with",
    "sages and I'm just like making money off",
    "of it right now spend your life in the",
    "company of geniuses sages children and",
    "books right yeah but again this is one",
    "of those things that figured through the",
    "show whenever I speak to monks they keep",
    "talking about the Flow State how it is",
    "meditative it is a form of working your",
    "mind towards Evolution but one needs to",
    "be humble with in the Flow State and",
    "understand that it's not their own",
    "thoughts and creativity but it's being",
    "placed in their head externally by the",
    "yeah in a real Flow State you're not",
    "thinking about yourself so it's not",
    "coming from this look when when we self",
    "is a very loaded word right it's another",
    "one of the self it's another one of",
    "these words that can mean a lot of",
    "different things",
    "but there's kind of the separate self",
    "the identity the story The Character the",
    "name the uh kind of the the emotional",
    "predilections toward doing certain",
    "certain things and not doing others the",
    "reactions the memories that's the false",
    "self okay we know that from Hinduism and",
    "Buddhism and Hindu mythology and they've",
    "written it down much better than I could",
    "ever say um that's the false self but",
    "yet that's the self that we function",
    "under 95% of the time and when we go",
    "into a flow state that self quiets down",
    "for a bit and then All That Remains is",
    "true self which is",
    "just I don't have a name for it maybe",
    "you have name for it it's just the thing",
    "that is right it's existence itself it's",
    "Consciousness it's awareness to me",
    "they're identical right as an aside one",
    "of the I think I think there's a lot of",
    "great questions out there that people",
    "just don't ask because they're so",
    "cliched right so uh one of the questions",
    "I love is like if a tree falls in the",
    "forest and there's no one around to hear",
    "it doesn't make a sound so cliche I",
    "think about that one all the time you",
    "know because it really asks a question",
    "like you know is existence and are",
    "existence and Consciousness the same",
    "thing like in what sense can something",
    "be said to exist if nothing is ever",
    "conscious of it or its or its effects um",
    "another one that I like to think about",
    "is the philosophical zombie problem",
    "which is uh you know why do we even need",
    "Consciousness why couldn't you just be",
    "walking around reacting like an",
    "automaton to everything and I could see",
    "the exact same reactions the exact same",
    "emotions and whatever but you just don't",
    "need to be conscious why why why does",
    "that why aren't we all just uh philosop",
    "why aren't we all just zombies um and",
    "actually it's funny because the Buddhist",
    "answer to that is if you think it",
    "through it's kind of it's not why",
    "Consciousness the answer is why zombie",
    "like does the zombie actually exist or",
    "is that just a figment of the you know",
    "awareness's imagination um another one",
    "that I like is uh you know some of the",
    "wisdom that's really old is so embedded",
    "in culture we don't think about it uh",
    "row row row your boat you know that one",
    "row row row your boat gently down the",
    "stream yeah it's so smart nobody thinks",
    "about it nobody talks it's so smart",
    "that's that's like one of the greatest",
    "works of art ever created row row row",
    "your boat in other words your work right",
    "the analogy is you're sitting in a boat",
    "you're kind of by yourself yeah there",
    "might be other boats but you're kind of",
    "by yourself you're rowing you got to row",
    "you got to do some work gently down the",
    "stream gently yeah you don't struggle",
    "too much you know you kind of have to",
    "figure out what you can navigate without",
    "getting all stressed out down the stream",
    "it's a good analogy for Life the river",
    "you know it's going off you know it's",
    "going to die at the end um merrily",
    "merrily merily merily yeah that's that's",
    "the right attitude life is but a dream",
    "that's the cold hard truth life is but a",
    "dream it appears it disappears it ends",
    "Infinity on both sides right there's so",
    "much wisdom in that little poem and",
    "stuck around forever but instead we have",
    "to go looking at complicated books to",
    "figure this out as I've learned through",
    "the show they say that the curse of",
    "human life is that once you die you",
    "realize that human life was the",
    "dream yeah I mean nobody knows what",
    "happens when you die right that's kind",
    "of the mystery that makes it all fun um",
    "but you know to your point about being",
    "attracted to like Indian",
    "uh sort of ideals and memories I I have",
    "found as I grow older I gravitate more",
    "and more towards those things like um do",
    "you mind that I'm bringing it up so much",
    "in this conv no no it's fine it's fine",
    "anything is fine it's just a part of my",
    "identity yeah it's fine I mean I'm",
    "Indian too by origin and probably will",
    "end up back there at some point when I'm",
    "old enough you know I think about it I I",
    "like India I love India these are these",
    "are these are my brothers and sisters",
    "right these are my people I am I am one",
    "of them so there's a couple of places I",
    "would love to take you to in India I",
    "told you about one of them in the car uh",
    "which is the mountains like Himalayas",
    "there too many Secrets like that's where",
    "you actually find the wisdom of the",
    "sages and you feel it in the air the",
    "other place is Banaras Varanasi yeah",
    "which is in according to sanatan it's",
    "the oldest city in the world and you do",
    "feel that it is chaotic but there's",
    "another part of it that's extremely",
    "quiet there's a part of Banaras called",
    "the manikarnika G mhm where they",
    "perpetually burn bodies for the sake of",
    "cremation MH mhm they say that when you",
    "stand at the manikara and you view the",
    "bodies burning whatever is inside you",
    "FRS up and comes on to the outside and",
    "that's where something inside you shifts",
    "so for me I just became very curious and",
    "I became more serious about this journey",
    "of podcasting I realized that this is my",
    "true iy guy um Japanese concept for the",
    "sake of curiosity because you come uh",
    "face to face with death you see human",
    "body's burning you know if if you",
    "actually view a human body burning at",
    "some point the skull",
    "explodes so when you see that happening",
    "in front of you it shifts something",
    "inside and I Feel Again India is",
    "definitely not for everyone but it is",
    "for Seekers I mean if you could keep",
    "your death in front of you at all times",
    "you would live a magical life then you",
    "would value the exact moment at it's you",
    "know as being the complete and wholesome",
    "and only real sacred thing that exist",
    "do you keep it death in front of you I",
    "try to it's not it doesn't always work",
    "but I do it's",
    "probably it's probably the most",
    "liberating thing that I do it's not I",
    "don't do it as an exercise I just but it",
    "is on my mind a lot what's an ideal",
    "death for",
    "you it doesn't matter hopefully not",
    "slowly or painfully but you know it's",
    "it's when it when it's gone it's gone I",
    "guess the ideal would be it would be",
    "good to be to have uh self-realized",
    "before for that you know ultimate",
    "truth be good I don't know if there's",
    "such a thing that's that's Enlightenment",
    "is not something you",
    "necessarily from what I can tell it's",
    "not something you necessarily find or",
    "create it's more just unlearning it's a",
    "shedding it's what remains when",
    "everything else is gone so it's it is a",
    "mini death of its own sort it is a death",
    "of the separate self in the mind um and",
    "I'm not looking for that kind of death",
    "but I would say I'm looking for truth",
    "and if that's true then I'll take the",
    "truth I'll take the truth TR I'll take",
    "an unhappy truth over a lie any day and",
    "I don't think it's an unhappy truth",
    "anyway but it doesn't matter I'm I'm",
    "open to whatever the truth is if the",
    "truth is oh I'm just a brain and a vat",
    "this is a simulation and someone's pting",
    "and poking at me and they're going to",
    "torture me for eternity fine show me the",
    "truth I'd rather know the truth you know",
    "in The Joe Rogan episode you spoke about",
    "how uh you used to meditate yeah and you",
    "would just view your own thoughts You'",
    "sit in a place and just view your own",
    "thoughts and through that process",
    "sometimes you read Stillness but you",
    "also had some psychedelic experiences do",
    "you ever think about",
    "those I kind of got bored of it um and",
    "and I and I just I don't think",
    "experiences are are the thing did the",
    "distractions yes any experience that",
    "comes will also go uh the the thing that",
    "matters is what your state of mind is",
    "you know at 2:30 p.m. in the afternoon",
    "when you're sitting by yourself how do",
    "you feel are you are you peaceful are",
    "you happy are you good you know 2:37",
    "p.m. you're walking down the street are",
    "you okay how do you feel are you good",
    "that's what matters Ms right it's the",
    "exact moment in time what is your",
    "internal State what is your external",
    "State um you know what are the thoughts",
    "that are going through your head if any",
    "that's what matters so I don't want",
    "Bliss for an hour a day uh that's just",
    "another experience that comes and goes I",
    "want I want something that's",
    "indestructible did you ever smoke",
    "weed uh you know I live in",
    "California when you were younger no no",
    "know luckily that's the kind of thing",
    "that if I discovered in my youth I don't",
    "think I would have had a very productive",
    "youth because you get too into it yeah",
    "it's it's it's it's too easy to turn off",
    "your brain I think things like weed uh",
    "you know the the West is going through a",
    "very hedonistic phase where it's all",
    "about being single and partying and",
    "doing drugs and um those are hard things",
    "to resist they can really destroy your",
    "sense of self-being uh I've definitely",
    "seen people who have done way too many",
    "even like say for example common belief",
    "now is that like mushrooms are harmless",
    "right they're not I mean you do enough",
    "of that stuff it'll break your brain",
    "you'll end up believing too many things",
    "that aren't real um you know same thing",
    "with weed it'll rob you of ambition",
    "because it's it's a very feminizing drug",
    "it's a plant estrogen so you're just",
    "going to sit there all day and smoke",
    "weed and you're not going to go do",
    "anything with your life so yes there are",
    "definitely things that I have tried but",
    "luckily I would say I'm I I'm not",
    "getting sucked into any of them fair I",
    "mean even water in excess is bad sure",
    "alth that one we're pretty well evolved",
    "for right it's just like for example if",
    "you just from an evolutionary past if",
    "You' had access to like easy weed all",
    "the time you would have gotten eaten by",
    "something right you wouldn't have made",
    "it very far um it's just in modern",
    "society yeah we can do that modern",
    "society is really weird where we we've",
    "we've changed our physical environment",
    "much faster than we're adapted for so we",
    "do need all kinds of coping mechanisms",
    "right for example we're all overfed",
    "we're UND ex exercised uh we're",
    "overstimulated uh our minds are worrying",
    "about far away things right the media",
    "the purpose of the media as I've joked",
    "before is to make every problem your",
    "problem right you go on you go on social",
    "media and it's just all dueling meme",
    "viruses each one trying to occupy a slot",
    "in your brain to Make You Care well you",
    "know thousand years ago someone could",
    "have gotten shot or blown up in some Far",
    "Away country you would have never heard",
    "about it you had no stake in it you had",
    "no way of knowing about it now it's just",
    "your brain is not man is not designed to",
    "handle all the world's emergencies in",
    "real time as they break it's breaking",
    "your brain at some deep level you're not",
    "even meant to see violence or",
    "pornography like those are very weird",
    "and rare and unique new things uh and so",
    "the modern struggle is to navigate",
    "through the fruits of",
    "abundance uh that are wrecking you right",
    "it's actually the",
    "the the challenge of modernity is",
    "avoiding the fruits of modernity right",
    "for you have to become almost a yogi in",
    "self-defense uh to protect yourself it's",
    "called ver in in our culture and it",
    "means being in the middle of a party",
    "yeah and seeing everyone party around",
    "you and being happy for them but not",
    "taking part in the party yourself other",
    "than just keeping your mind there yeah",
    "this is why I'm finding it harder and",
    "harder to go to",
    "parties because it's hard not to get",
    "involved and to indulge but it's so",
    "meaningless it's just another game right",
    "uh and they're fun and occasionally I do",
    "go to parties and I do like a good party",
    "and you have a higher odds of dragging",
    "me out to good party than to like some",
    "tedious meeting um but all that said",
    "like Even parties have kind of lost",
    "their",
    "luster what's Nal R can't like when he's",
    "drunk or",
    "high uh same but more talkative more",
    "talkative more talkative yeah because",
    "you're inherently a bit of an introvert",
    "yes yeah got yeah on a podcast I'm not",
    "but uh left to my own devices I'm very",
    "much an inter I would much rather read",
    "or be on the Internet or just be walking",
    "around thinking",
    "or you know listening to YouTube or a",
    "podcast or something than uh hanging out",
    "with people do you miss your",
    "childhood",
    "no but I don't really think about it I",
    "don't think about the past much",
    "consciously yeah they when you're asking",
    "me the question I'm being forced to",
    "think about it for the first time in a",
    "long time my bad no no there's nothing",
    "wrong with it I'm just saying I don't",
    "think about it so I don't I don't have a",
    "I don't have a predigested answer for",
    "you that's great yeah no but I would say",
    "no I don't miss my childhood I don't",
    "it's it's like a dream is it real did it",
    "actually",
    "happen wow there's a quote that goes",
    "like the past is fiction it is fiction",
    "the P the past is uh it it is a",
    "narrative you don't remember most of it",
    "the little bit that you do remember is",
    "very selective memory stitched into a",
    "narrative uh there's no point in really",
    "remembering it uh presumably there are",
    "lessons to learn but you probably",
    "already digested those and learned them",
    "you don't even have to think about those",
    "uh so what's the",
    "point um do you think about about the",
    "future at",
    "all uh I think about the future for",
    "practical things career stuff well like",
    "yeah if I have to make money or an",
    "investment or if I have to like figure",
    "out what to do with the this child and",
    "this problem and solve that or you know",
    "where do I want to have dinner so yeah",
    "and that sense we are future planners",
    "but uh I don't I don't think too far",
    "ahead I don't I don't obsess over it but",
    "I'm more of a future creature than a",
    "past creature for sure uh in an ideal",
    "world I wouldn't think that much about",
    "the future either but I'm not there I",
    "think we're forced to in order you have",
    "to I mean you're you're a functioning",
    "creature that has to navigate the world",
    "but I I I I want to think about the",
    "future as regards to utilitarian things",
    "you know food money uh you know those",
    "kinds of things problem solving I don't",
    "want to think about the future in sense",
    "of what does it hold for me like am I",
    "going to be happy am I going to be uh in",
    "a good relationship you know am I going",
    "to die like the death thing is",
    "interesting to think about you kind of",
    "can't look away it's like the most",
    "important thing that's going to happen",
    "to you right so you have to think about",
    "it but uh I I don't want to think about",
    "I don't want to self-",
    "obsess in the future the reason I don't",
    "self- obsess anymore or never even got",
    "that into it is because I just found it",
    "both a waste of time uh as well as it",
    "was just destroying my",
    "happiness happiness is a big word so",
    "more peace intruding on my peace gotcha",
    "I think we're almost at the end of the",
    "episode episode what advice do you have",
    "for me I don't have advice for you I",
    "mean you you must have gotten to know",
    "something about me at this point or",
    "maybe I'll ask you the career advice",
    "aspect because I could reframe this",
    "question as how do you view the world of",
    "content creators going into the future I",
    "would okay I'll give you some advice I",
    "like I like being provocative so uh I",
    "would say be selfish be more selfish uh",
    "make sure you really enjoy your work",
    "make sure you really are only working",
    "with the people that you really like",
    "doing like working with uh make sure you",
    "are only have the guests on that you're",
    "proud to have on that you genuinely want",
    "to have conversations with um because I",
    "I think the the value you've already",
    "built something of incredible value and",
    "it's going to continue compounding so",
    "the value now is about the longevity how",
    "long can you keep it going whether you",
    "go to episode a th000 or 2,000 or 5,000",
    "matters more than uh you know you don't",
    "want to be in grinder mode if you're",
    "just grinding you're going to burn out",
    "and the day you or not this thing is",
    "over so I would say just make sure you",
    "enjoy yourself and uh so that's part of",
    "it uh so be selfish and make sure you",
    "enjoy yourself and then the second part",
    "of being selfish is talk to people where",
    "you genuinely want to talk to them don't",
    "don't just record a podcast or record a",
    "podcast because you know you have to",
    "make certain amount of money or you got",
    "to check a box because you will be",
    "judged at the end of the day by your",
    "best work not by any by your average all",
    "my content that is out there that people",
    "like I didn't do it for them I didn't do",
    "it for anything I didn't do it for",
    "anyone I just did it for me and it was",
    "deeply selfish it was just notes to self",
    "and there's nothing wrong with that",
    "because we're all the same inside so if",
    "you if you're creating art then you do",
    "it for its own sake you do it because",
    "you enjoy it and then other people will",
    "see the same thing that you saw in it um",
    "and they'll get value out of it so I say",
    "just be selfish and you can sustain it",
    "okay now I will uh you know take the",
    "layers off I'll take the filters off and",
    "tell you that this was one of the",
    "biggest days of my podcasting career man",
    "you're very nice um you have helped me",
    "so much from a professional perspective",
    "being on the other side of the world and",
    "just speaking on other podcasts and",
    "there's so many people like me who just",
    "sit in different parts of this globe and",
    "consume pieces of Your Mind through",
    "Twitter through the stuff you say on",
    "podcast and I know you're very",
    "nonchalant about it like you're just",
    "enjoying it but you're adding so much",
    "value to our lives and so many of us",
    "have daddy issues and mommy issues and I",
    "think Nal ravikant has become kind of a",
    "big brother figure to people all over",
    "the globe and to just be able to share",
    "screen space with you is one of the",
    "biggest honors of my life yeah at the",
    "same time the worst thing I could do for",
    "myself is is get into the idea of having",
    "a fan base because uh Fame is a beast",
    "it'll lead you alive and I don't want to",
    "do anything for other people I don't",
    "care about if they respect me or not",
    "disrespect all day long who cares sh I",
    "mean I hear you uh and you know just",
    "observing you go about how you handle F",
    "we were together at an event right now",
    "it it's taught me a lot uh just sharing",
    "I don't think I handle it well you know",
    "I get approached by a lot of people they",
    "want to take a photo it always kind of",
    "weirds me out a little bit uh no it's",
    "just it'd be better not to be famous to",
    "be honest if I had to do it over again",
    "it might be better to be",
    "anonymous thank God you're not",
    "Anonymous but Nal genuinely from the",
    "bottom of my heart I bow down to you no",
    "don't bows please that's embarrassing PE",
    "relationships only I I hear you but no",
    "bows no gurus anybody calls me you want",
    "to not be my friend call me a guru not",
    "going to be friends I I don't think",
    "you're a guru but you are a bit of a b",
    "you know what bayya means brother yeah",
    "big brother yeah so that's what I look",
    "at you as and that's how a lot of brown",
    "people look at you as we're all brothers",
    "that works there's some people who just",
    "emit that Sensei energy and it's not",
    "their will again it's the universe",
    "working through you that's how I look at",
    "you so thank you for everything you've",
    "given all of us you're guiding a lot of",

    "flew from halfway across the world uh",
    "our common friend Balaji told me uh that",
    "there is this opportunity and nal's",
    "agreed to do this particular episode so",
    "this was the first ever episode we shot",
    "on foreign soil in my eyes it's the",
    "first International episode on TRS even",

    "schweger in Korea we've shot an episode",
    "with Ronnie Coleman in India we've shot",

    "podcasting Journey Begins with this very",
    "important and very iconic episode of the",
    "ranir show couldn't sleep on the night",
    "of this episode because this was a very",
    "important life moment for me it's",
    "something I've visualized for a very",
    "long time before we executed upon this",
    "podcast uh dream come true for anyone",
    "who's been listening to podcasts for the",
    "last decade",
    "we all know what a big deal naal",

    "Happiness is being satisfied with what",
    "you have. Success comes from",
    "dissatisfaction. Is success worth it",
    "then? Oof. I'm not sure that statement",
    "is true anymore. Like I made that",
    "statement a long time ago and a lot of",
    "these things are just notes to myself",
    "and they're highly contextual. They come",
    "in the moment, they leave in the",
    "moment. Happiness. Okay. So very",
    "complicated topic but I always like the",
    "Socrates story where he goes into the",
    "marketplace and they show him all these",
    "luxuries and fineries and he says how",
    "many things there are in this world that",
    "I do not want right and that's a form of",
    "freedom so not wanting something is as",
    "good as having it in the old story with",
    "Alexander Dionius right Alexander goes",
    "out and conquers the world and he meets",
    "Dionius who's living in a barrel and",
    "Dionius says get out of the way you're",
    "blocking my son and Alexander says oh",
    "how I wish I you know could be like",
    "Dionius the next life and dianis says",
    "that's the difference I don't wish that",
    "I could sorry Dioynes Dioynes Dioynes",
    "says I I I don't wish to be Alexander so",
    "two paths to happiness and uh one path",
    "is success you get what you want you",
    "satisfy your material needs or like",
    "Dioynes you just don't want in the first",
    "place and I'm not sure which one is more",
    "valid",
    "um and it also depends what you define",
    "as success if the end goal is happiness",
    "then why not cut to the chase and just",
    "go straight for",
    "uh does being happy make you less",
    "successful? That is a conventional",
    "wisdom. That may even be the practical",
    "earned experience of your reality. You",
    "find that when you're happy, you don't",
    "want anything. So, you don't get up and",
    "do anything. On the other hand, you",
    "know, you still got to do something.",
    "You're an animal. You're here. You're",
    "here to survive. You're here to",
    "replicate. You're driven. You're",
    "motivated. You're going to do something.",
    "You're not just going to sit there all",
    "day. Unlikely. Some people do. Maybe",
    "it's in their nature. But I think most",
    "people still want to act. they want to",
    "live in the arena. Uh I found for myself",
    "as I've become uh happier is a big word,",
    "but you know, more peaceful, more calm,",
    "more present, more uh satisfied with",
    "what I have, uh I still want to do",
    "things. I just want to do bigger things.",
    "I want to do things that are more pure,",
    "more aligned with uh what I think needs",
    "to be done and what I can uniquely do.",
    "So in that sense, I think that being",
    "happier can actually make you more",
    "successful, but your definition of",
    "success will likely change along the",
    "way. Is that a realization you think you",
    "could have gotten to had you have not",
    "had some success in the first place?",
    "At least for me, I always wanted to take",
    "the path of material success first. I",
    "was not going to go be an aesthetic and",
    "sit there and renounce everything. That",
    "just seems too unrealistic and too",
    "painful. Uh, in the story of Buddha, he",
    "starts out as a prince and then he sees",
    "that it's all kind of meaningless",
    "because you're still going to get old",
    "and die and then he goes into the woods",
    "looking for something",
    "more. I'll take the happy route that",
    "involves material success. Thank you. I",
    "think it's quicker in some ways. You",
    "know, one of your uh insights is it's",
    "far easier to achieve our material",
    "desires than it is to renounce them. And",
    "uh it depends on the person, but I I",
    "think you have to try that path. If you",
    "want something, go get it. Uh, you know,",
    "like I I I quipped that the reason to",
    "win the game is to be free of it. So,",
    "you you play the games, you win the",
    "games, and then you get hopefully you",
    "get bored of the games. You don't want",
    "to just keep looping on the same game",
    "over and over. Although a lot of these",
    "games are very enticing and have many",
    "levels and are relatively open-ended.",
    "Uh, and then you become free of the game",
    "uh in a sense that you're no longer",
    "trying to win it. You know, you can win",
    "it. Uh, and either you move to a",
    "different game or you play the game for",
    "the sheer joy of it. Yeah. You, another",
    "one of yours, most of the gains in life",
    "come from suffering in the short term so",
    "you can get paid in the long term. I",
    "think that's classic. Winning the",
    "marshmallow test on a daily basis. But,",
    "uh, there's an interesting challenge",
    "where I think people need to avoid",
    "becoming uh, a suffering addict. Sort of",
    "using suffering as the proxy for",
    "progress as opposed to the outcome of",
    "the suffering. Right? It's like I was in",
    "pain not eating the marshmallow. I was",
    "in pain doing this work. I have attached",
    "well-being and satisfaction to pain, not",
    "to what the pain gets me on the other",
    "side of it. If you define pain as",
    "physical pain, then it's a real thing.",
    "It happens and you can't ignore it. But",
    "that's not what we mean by suffering.",
    "Suffering is mostly mental anguish and",
    "mental pain. And it just means you don't",
    "want to do the task at hand. Uh if you",
    "were fine doing the task at hand, then",
    "you wouldn't be suffering. And then the",
    "question is what's more effective to",
    "suffer along the way or just to",
    "interpret it in a way that it's not",
    "suffering? You hear from a lot of",
    "successful people they look back and",
    "they say oh the journey was the fun part",
    "right that was actually the entertaining",
    "part and I should have enjoyed it more.",
    "It's a common regret. Uh there's a",
    "little thought exercise I like to do",
    "which is you can go back into your own",
    "life and uh try to put yourself in the",
    "exact position you were in 5 years ago,",
    "10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago",
    "and you try to remember okay who was I",
    "with what was I doing? What was I",
    "feeling? What were my emotions? What",
    "were my objectives? And really really",
    "try to transport yourself back and see",
    "if there's any advice you'd give",
    "yourself. Anything you do differently.",
    "Now you don't have new information. And",
    "don't pretend you could have gone back",
    "and, you know, bought a stock or bought",
    "bought Bitcoin or whatever, but just",
    "knowing what you know now in terms of",
    "your temperament and a little bit of age",
    "related",
    "experience, how would you have done",
    "things differently? And I think it's a",
    "worthwhile exercise to do. So don't let",
    "me rob you of the conclusion, but I'll",
    "tell you for me",
    "uh I would have done everything the same",
    "except I would have done it with less",
    "anger, less emotion, less internal",
    "suffering because that was optional. It",
    "wasn't necessary. And I would argue that",
    "someone who can do the job uh at least",
    "peacefully but maybe happily is going to",
    "be more effective than someone who has",
    "unnecessary emotional turmoil. Well, you",
    "end up with a series of miserable",
    "successes, right? The outcome may have",
    "been the same, but the entire experience",
    "of getting there and and the journey is",
    "not only the reward. The journey is the",
    "only thing there is. You know, even",
    "success, it's human nature to bank it",
    "very very quickly, right? Because the",
    "normal loop that we run through is you",
    "sit around, you're bored, then you want",
    "something, then when you want something,",
    "you decide you're not going to be happy",
    "until you get that thing. Then you start",
    "your bout of suffering or anticipation",
    "while you strive to get that thing. If",
    "you get that thing, then you get used to",
    "it and then you get bored again. Then a",
    "few months later, you want something",
    "else. And if you don't get it, then",
    "you're unhappy for a bit and then you",
    "get over it and then you want something",
    "else. Right? That's the normal cycle. So",
    "whether you're happy or unhappy at the",
    "end, it tends not to last. Now I don't",
    "want to be glib and say that oh there's",
    "no point in making money or being",
    "successful. There absolutely is. Money",
    "solves all your money problems. So it is",
    "good to have money. Um that said there",
    "are those uh those stories. I I don't",
    "know if you've seen those studies. I",
    "don't know how real these are. A lot of",
    "these psych studies don't replicate, but",
    "it's a fun fun little study that shows",
    "that uh people who break their back and",
    "people who win the lottery are back to",
    "their baseline happiness two years",
    "later. Yep. Again, I don't know if",
    "that's entirely true. I think money can",
    "buy you happiness if you earned it",
    "because then along the way you have both",
    "pride and confidence in yourself and you",
    "have a sense of accomplishment and you",
    "you know set out to do something and you",
    "were right. So I I'll bet that lingers",
    "and then as I said money solves your",
    "money problem. So I don't want to be too",
    "glib about it but I would say in general",
    "this this loop that we run through um of",
    "desire, dopamine, fulfillment,",
    "unfulfillment like you you have to enjoy",
    "the journey. The journey is all there",
    "is, right? 99% of your time is spent on",
    "the journey. So, what kind of a journey",
    "is it if you're not going to enjoy it?",
    "How do you shortcut that desire",
    "contract?",
    "You could focus, you could decide that I",
    "don't want most things. I think we have",
    "a lot of unnecessary desires that we",
    "just pick up everywhere. We have",
    "opinions on everything, judgments and",
    "everything. Uh so, I think just knowing",
    "that those are the source of unhappiness",
    "uh will make you be choosy about your",
    "desires. And frankly, if you want to be",
    "successful, you have to be choosy about",
    "your desires. You have to focus. You",
    "can't be great at everything. You can't",
    "be great at everything. You're just",
    "going to waste your energy and waste",
    "your time. Is fame a worthwhile goal?",
    "Uh, it gets you invited to better",
    "parties, gets you into better",
    "restaurants. Uh, fame. So, fa fame is",
    "this funny thing where a lot of people",
    "know you, but you don't know them. And,",
    "uh, it does get you put on a pedestal.",
    "Uh, it can get you what you want, uh, at",
    "a at a distance. So, I wouldn't say it's",
    "worthless. Obviously, people want it for",
    "a reason. Um, it's high status, so it",
    "attracts the opposite sex. Uh,",
    "especially for men, it attracts women.",
    "Uh, that said, it is high cost. It means",
    "you have no privacy. Um, you do have",
    "weirdos and lunatics. Uh, you do get hit",
    "up a lot for weird things. Uh, and",
    "you're on a stage, so you're forced to",
    "perform, so you're forced to be",
    "consistent with your past proclamations",
    "and actions, and you're going to have",
    "haters and all that nonsense. But the",
    "fact that we do it, the fact that we all",
    "seem to want it means that it would be",
    "disingenuous to say, \"Oh, no, no, I'm",
    "famous.\" But you don't want to be",
    "famous. Um, that said, I think fame,",
    "like anything else, is best produced as",
    "a or pursued as a byproduct of something",
    "potentially more worthwhile. Um, wanting",
    "to be famous and craving to be famous",
    "and being famous for being famous, these",
    "are sort of traps. Fame for fame's sake.",
    "Yeah. Exactly. So, it's better that it's",
    "earned fame. Uh so for example earn",
    "respect in the tribe is you do things",
    "that are good for the tribe. Uh who are",
    "the most famous people in human history?",
    "Uh there uh you know there there are",
    "people who sort of transcended the self.",
    "The Buddhas and the Jesuses and the",
    "Muhammads of the world. Who else is",
    "famous? Uh the artists are famous. You",
    "know art lasts for a long time. The",
    "scientists are famous. They discover",
    "thing. The conquerors are famous",
    "presumably because they conquered for",
    "their tribe. There was someone that they",
    "were fighting for.",
    "So generally the higher up you rise by",
    "doing things for greater and greater",
    "groups of people even though it may be",
    "considered tyrannical or negative like",
    "uh you know Jenghaskhan is famous but uh",
    "to the Mongols he was doing good to the",
    "rest of them not so much",
    "uh the higher level you're operating at",
    "the more people you're taking care of",
    "the more you sort of earn respect and",
    "fame and I think those are good reasons",
    "to be famous if if if fame is empty if",
    "you're famous just cuz your name showed",
    "up in a lot of places or your face",
    "showed up in a lot of places then that's",
    "a hollow fame and I think deep down you",
    "will know that and so it'll be fragile",
    "and you'll always be afraid of losing it",
    "and then you'll be forced to perform so",
    "the kind of fame that uh pure actors and",
    "celebrities have I wouldn't want but the",
    "kind of fame that's earned because you",
    "did something useful uh why dodge that",
    "now you can there's a challenge I think",
    "especially if people make uh very loud",
    "public proclamations about things you",
    "mentioned there about um you're almost",
    "hostage to the things that you used to",
    "say that um being able to update your",
    "opinions and change your mind looks very",
    "similar to the internet as hypocrisy",
    "does. No, no, no. The difference between",
    "me saying something in the past and",
    "saying something different now is",
    "perhaps I've learned, perhaps I've",
    "updated my beliefs, but so few people do",
    "it in a legitimate way. I think that the",
    "grifter shill you see this is the the",
    "the smoking gun that shows that he",
    "didn't really believe that thing all",
    "along. Right. And uh yeah, I I went to a",
    "retreat in LA a couple of years ago and",
    "there was a guy that I used to follow",
    "that a big um business and productivity",
    "advice content creator really really",
    "successful and he just totally stepped",
    "back from everything and went uh like",
    "monk mode and focused on his business. I",
    "asked him why and he said uh I started",
    "feeling like I had to live up to in",
    "private the things that I was saying in",
    "public. Right. Yeah. It's a it's a what",
    "was it that uh who said it was a mein",
    "that um foolish consistency is a",
    "hobgoblin of little minds right um but",
    "essentially look all life is all",
    "learning is error correction right every",
    "knowledge creation system works through",
    "correcting errors making guesses and",
    "correcting errors so by definition if",
    "you're learning you're going to be wrong",
    "most of the time and you'll be updating",
    "your priors and so for example I did",
    "this Joe Rogan podcast I don't know it's",
    "like eight or nine years ago um and",
    "people will call out like the thing that",
    "didn't turn out to be correct, right?",
    "And it's just like and they just beat on",
    "it because it it helps them in their",
    "mind raise their status a little bit.",
    "Aha, I caught him in an error. Well, I",
    "think if you catch someone in a blatant",
    "lie where there's believe one thing and",
    "they say another, that's legit. That's a",
    "character flaw. They shouldn't be lying.",
    "But on the other hand, if they just made",
    "a guess at something and they got it",
    "wrong. And by the way, mostly it's about",
    "the AI AGI thing. And I think I'm still",
    "right about that, but it's a different",
    "story. Um people who think we have",
    "achieved AGI just fail a touring test",
    "from their side. Um but",
    "uh it's funny how people latch on to",
    "single proclamations. But the reality is",
    "all of us are dynamical systems. We're",
    "always changing. We're always learning.",
    "We're always growing. And uh hopefully",
    "we're correcting errors. What you don't",
    "want to be doing is lying in public so",
    "that because you're you're trying to",
    "look good. And I think people can smell",
    "that. I I I what this world really lacks",
    "right now is authenticity and because",
    "everybody wants something. They want to",
    "be seen as something. They want to be",
    "something that they're not. And so you",
    "do catch a lot of people uh saying",
    "things that they don't really believe.",
    "And I think people are very sensitive to",
    "that. Uh [ __ ] radars have become",
    "hypersensitized to try and work out",
    "whether or not this person means the",
    "thing that they're saying. Yeah. I mean",
    "they they a lot of people are wrong.",
    "Most of us are wrong most of the time",
    "especially in any new endeavor.",
    "Difference between being wrong and",
    "disingenuous though, purposefully wrong.",
    "Correct. Exactly. So I think I think",
    "that's the big difference. If someone is",
    "wrong, no big deal. As long as they have",
    "a genuine reason for saying what they're",
    "saying, or believing what they're",
    "believing. But if they are lying to",
    "elevate their status or their appearance",
    "or to live up to some expectation,",
    "that's the mistake. And that's a mistake",
    "not just for the listener, it's a",
    "mistake for themselves cuz then you're",
    "going to get trapped in a hall of",
    "mirrors. You yourself are going to be",
    "consistent with your past proclamations.",
    "So if you're lying to others, you're",
    "going to be lying to yourself. You're",
    "puppeted by a person that you are not",
    "even. That's right. Yeah. It's it's like",
    "what was that line? There's you're",
    "you're basically trying to impress",
    "people who, you know, don't care about",
    "you. Um so they don't like the real you.",
    "And if they saw the real you, they",
    "wouldn't care. And the people who would",
    "like the real you don't get to see the",
    "real you. So they pass you by, right?",
    "You only want the respect of the very",
    "very few people that you respect. Uh",
    "trying to demand respect from the masses",
    "is a fool's errand.",
    "status games, the allure of acrewing,",
    "whether it's fame, actual fame, or just",
    "the competition comparison trap, it's",
    "always there. Uh there's a real draw of",
    "being swayed by social approval. How",
    "should people learn to get less",
    "distracted by status games in that",
    "way? I think it it just helps to see",
    "that status games don't matter as much",
    "as they used to. uh in old society,",
    "let's go back hunter gatherer times,",
    "there was no such thing as wealth. You",
    "just had what you could carry. Um there",
    "was no stored wealth. So wealth games",
    "didn't really exist to wealth creation",
    "games. All that existed was status",
    "games. If you were high status, then you",
    "got what little was available first. Um",
    "but even back then, you had to earn your",
    "status by taking care of the tribe. Uh",
    "now we have wealth creation where you",
    "can actually create a product or a",
    "service. you can scale that product or",
    "service and you can provide abundance",
    "for a lot of people. Uh and that's not",
    "zero sum, that's a positive sum game. I",
    "can be wealthy, you can be wealthy, we",
    "can create things together and clearly",
    "since we are all collectively far far",
    "wealthier than we were in huntergatherer",
    "times. Uh wealth creation is positive",
    "but status is limited. There's limited",
    "status to go around. It's a ranking",
    "ladder. It's a hierarchy. And so it's a",
    "rise in status. Somebody else has a",
    "lower in status. Now you can have",
    "multiple kinds of status. So you can",
    "expand some kinds of status, but it's",
    "not like wealth creation where it can go",
    "infinitely where we can all be, you",
    "know, living in the stars and moon bases",
    "or Mars colonies or what have you. So",
    "just realize that status games are",
    "inherently limited. Uh they're always",
    "combative. Um they always require uh",
    "direct combat whereas uh wealth creation",
    "games can be just you're creating",
    "products. You don't have to fight",
    "anybody else. Yes, in the marketplace",
    "your product has to succeed, but that's",
    "not quite the same as uh invective",
    "against other people or being angry with",
    "other people or feeling pushed down or",
    "pushed up or having a beef with",
    "somebody. So, I would argue that wealth",
    "creation games are both more pleasant.",
    "Uh they're positive sum and they",
    "actually have uh concrete material",
    "returns. If you have more money, you can",
    "buy more. Show me where you can exchange",
    "your status at the bank. Exactly. Yeah.",
    "It's it's it's vague and it's fuzzy.",
    "Now, you see people get rich, they have",
    "money, what do they want? They want",
    "status. So they go to Hollywood, start",
    "starring in movies, they donate to",
    "nonprofits, they go to KS or Davos or",
    "what have you. Um, and they start trying",
    "to trade the money for status. So, you",
    "know, people always want what they don't",
    "have. Uh, and we are evolutionarily",
    "hardwired for status because as I said,",
    "wealth creation didn't really exist",
    "until the agricultural revolution, uh,",
    "when you could store grain and then the",
    "industrial revolution took it to another",
    "level and now the information age is",
    "taking it to yet another level. But",
    "there's never been an easier time to",
    "make money. Yes, it's still hard, but",
    "there's never been an easier time to",
    "create wealth because there's so much",
    "leverage out there. There's so much",
    "opportunity. You still have to go find",
    "it. It's not easy. It's not going to",
    "fall on your lap, and you have to learn",
    "something and know something and do",
    "something interesting. But nevertheless,",
    "it's possible to many more",
    "people. A few hundred years ago, you",
    "were born a surf, you were going to die",
    "a surf. There was almost no way out of",
    "that. That's changed. And so I would",
    "argue that you're better off focusing on",
    "wealth games and status games. If you're",
    "trying to um build up, for example, your",
    "following on a social network and get",
    "famous and then get rich off of being",
    "famous. That's a much harder path than",
    "getting rich first. Um and then go for",
    "your fame afterwards would be my advice.",
    "Well, a lot of people do that as you",
    "said. It's funny how uh people who have",
    "achieved such a level of wealth that you",
    "don't think why do you need the status",
    "given that most people use status to",
    "then try and cash in to achieve wealth.",
    "If you've achieved [ __ ] money already,",
    "if you're post money or uh asset heavy",
    "as it's known, um why are you trying to",
    "go in the other direction? Well, as you",
    "said, because we've we've got an",
    "illustrious history biologically of",
    "wanting status, and wealth is kind of",
    "novel. It's new. It's new. Wealth is uh",
    "something that you have to understand",
    "more intellectually. Yeah, there's a",
    "physical component, more food, more",
    "survival, but uh to truly understand the",
    "effects and the powers and the abilities",
    "and the limitations uh and the",
    "advantages and disadvantages of wealth,",
    "you have to use your neoortex a lot",
    "more. Does that mean it's not limbic?",
    "The reason to play the game is to win",
    "the game and be done with it is harder",
    "to win and be done with for status than",
    "it is for wealth. That's a good",
    "observation. I had thought that through,",
    "but you're right. Yeah, I think that's",
    "right. I think you people will always",
    "want more status. Uh but I think you can",
    "be satisfied at a certain level of",
    "wealth. Well, as",
    "well you always have this sort of sense.",
    "This is what leaderboards are, right?",
    "This is the the billboard chart, right?",
    "And it is zero sum and it is I guess you",
    "know the Forbes richest people on the",
    "planet. That one's harder to climb the",
    "ladder on. But uh the fact that for",
    "example iTunes and YouTube can put you",
    "in competition against your",
    "contemporaries every single day and make",
    "you go up and down and show you likes",
    "and comments and ratings. This is how",
    "much felt. This is how much you're up.",
    "Exactly. They they keep you running on",
    "that treadmill forever. Jimmy Carr has",
    "this cool idea where he says trajectory",
    "is more important than position. So if",
    "you are number 101 in the world but last",
    "year you were number 200 versus you're",
    "number two in the world but last year",
    "you were number one. there is this sense",
    "of the deceleration is very very",
    "tangible and um it's again it goes back",
    "to evolution you know something that is",
    "bleeding eventually dies unless you stop",
    "the bleeding so you're you're hardwired",
    "not to lose what you have and because we",
    "evolve in conditions where we're so",
    "close to just not surviving uh you don't",
    "want to give anything up. It's hardwired",
    "into us to not give anything up. So you",
    "grip tightly. That's right. If you",
    "struggle to stay asleep because your",
    "body gets too hot or too cold, this is",
    "going to help. Just add an EightLe Pod 4",
    "Ultra to your mattress like a fitted",
    "sheet and it will automatically cool",
    "down or warm up each side of your bed up",
    "to 20°. It's got integrated sensors that",
    "track your sleep time, your sleep",
    "phases, your HRV, your snoring, and your",
    "heart rate with 99% accuracy. It even",
    "starts cooling or heating your bed an",
    "hour before you get into it. That is why",
    "eight has been clinically proven to",
    "increase total sleep up to 1 hour every",
    "night. Best of all, they've got a 30-day",
    "sleep trial, so you can buy it and sleep",
    "on it for 29 nights, and if you don't",
    "like it, they will give you your money",
    "back. Plus, they ship internationally.",
    "Right now, you can get $350 off the Pod4",
    "Ultra by going to the link in the",
    "description below or heading to",
    "8LE.com/modernwisdism and using the code",
    "modernwisdom a checkout. That's",
    "eigle.com/modernwisdom and modernwisdom",
    "a checkout. The worst outcome in the",
    "world is not having",
    "self-esteem. Why? Yeah, that's a tough",
    "one. Uh,",
    "well, I I I look at the people and I",
    "don't want to offend anybody, but I look",
    "at the people who don't like themselves,",
    "and that's the toughest slot because",
    "they're always wrestling with",
    "themselves, and it's hard enough to face",
    "the outside world. Um, and no one's",
    "going to like you more than you like",
    "yourself. So, if you're struggling with",
    "yourself, then the outside world becomes",
    "an insurmountable challenge. And it's",
    "hard to say why people have low",
    "self-esteem. It might be genetic. It",
    "might just be circumstantial. A lot of",
    "times I think it's cuz they just weren't",
    "unconditionally loved as a child. And",
    "that sort of seeps in at a deep core",
    "level. Um but self-esteem issues can be",
    "the most limiting. Uh one interesting",
    "thought is that you know to some extent",
    "self-esteem is a reputation you have",
    "with yourself. Um you're watching",
    "yourself at all times. You know what",
    "you're doing and you have your own moral",
    "code. Everyone has a different moral",
    "code. But if you don't live up to your",
    "own moral code, the same code that you",
    "hold others to, uh it will damage your",
    "self-esteem. So perhaps one way to build",
    "up your self-esteem is to live up to",
    "your own code very rigorously. Have one",
    "and then live up to it. Uh another way",
    "to raise your self-esteem might be to do",
    "things for others. Uh if I look back on",
    "my life and you know what are the",
    "moments that I'm actually proud of,",
    "there's very far and few between and",
    "it's not that often and it's not the",
    "things you would expect. It's not the",
    "material success. It's not having",
    "learned this thing or that. It's when I",
    "made a sacrifice for somebody or",
    "something that I loved. And uh that's",
    "when I'm actually ironically most proud.",
    "Now that's through an explicit mental",
    "exercise. But I'll bet you at some level",
    "I'm recording that implicitly. So that",
    "tells me that even if I am not being",
    "loved and the way to create love is to",
    "give love to to express love through",
    "sacrifice and through duty. And so I",
    "think doing things like that can build",
    "up your self-esteem really fast. It's",
    "interesting when you talk about",
    "sacrifice because a lot of the time",
    "people say, \"I sacrificed so much for my",
    "job.\" It's like, \"Yeah, but that was you",
    "sacrificing something that you wanted",
    "less for something that you wanted more",
    "as opposed to genuinely taking some sort",
    "of cost.\" And uh yeah, I wonder whether",
    "if self-esteem is you adhering to your",
    "internal your your actions and your",
    "values aligning um even when it's",
    "difficult or perhaps even more so when",
    "it's difficult. I wonder whether there",
    "is a price that people who are more",
    "introspective, high integrity pay",
    "because you think well you've got this",
    "uh heavy set of overheads that you need",
    "to pay in some way. Well, if being",
    "ethical were profitable, everybody would",
    "do it, right? So, uh you at some level",
    "it does involve a sacrifice. Uh but that",
    "sacrifice can also be thought of as",
    "you're thinking for the long term rather",
    "than the short term. Um for example the",
    "virtues are the set of",
    "uh virtues a set of beliefs that if",
    "everybody in society followed them as",
    "individuals it would lead to win-win",
    "outcomes for everybody. So if I am",
    "honest and you are honest then we can do",
    "business more easily. We can interact",
    "more easily because we can trust each",
    "other. So even though there might be a",
    "few liars in the system as long as there",
    "aren't too many liars and too many",
    "cheaters uh a high trust society where",
    "everybody's honest is better off. And I",
    "think a lot of the virtues work this way",
    "right? If I don't go around sleeping",
    "with your wife and you don't sleep with",
    "mine and you know if I don't take all",
    "the food that's at the table first and",
    "so on, then we all get along better and",
    "we can play win-win games. Uh in game",
    "theory, the most famous game is",
    "prisoners dilemma. But that's all about",
    "everybody cheating and the Nash",
    "equilibrium. The stable equilibrium",
    "there is everybody cheats and you're for",
    "the only way you can be you can play a",
    "win-win game is if you have long-term",
    "iterated moves. But that's not actually",
    "the most common game played in society.",
    "The most common game played as one",
    "called a stags hunt where if we",
    "cooperate, we can bring down a big stag",
    "and both have big dinners, but if we",
    "don't cooperate, then we have to go hunt",
    "like rabbits and we each have small",
    "dinners. So most of uh and and that game",
    "has two stable equilibriums. And one",
    "could be where we're both hunting the",
    "rabbit and one could be where we're",
    "hunting the stag. So the high trust",
    "society is a more most more virtuous",
    "society where I can trust you to come",
    "hunt the stag with me and show up on",
    "time and do the work and divide it up",
    "properly. So you want to live in a",
    "system where everybody has their own set",
    "of virtues and follows them and then we",
    "all win. But I would argue you don't",
    "need to do that for sacrifice. You don't",
    "need to do that for other people. You",
    "can do it just purely for yourself. You",
    "will have higher self-esteem. You will",
    "attract other high virtue people. Would",
    "I go on a stag hunt with me? Correct.",
    "Yeah, that's right. And if you're the",
    "kind of person, if you're the kind of",
    "person who long-term signals ethics and",
    "virtues, then you will attract other",
    "people who are ethical and virtuous.",
    "Whereas, if you are a shark, you will",
    "eventually find yourself swimming",
    "entirely amongst sharks. And that's an",
    "unpleasant existence. But again, this",
    "goes back to the equivalent of the",
    "marshmallow test. And by the way, the",
    "marshmallow test does not replicate. I",
    "saw it replication crisis hard recently.",
    "But it is about trading off the short",
    "term for the long term. Uh, and so I",
    "think for a lot of these so-called",
    "virtues, there are long-term selfish",
    "reasons to be virtuous.",
    "Yeah. Uh, did you deal with self-doubt",
    "in the past? Is that something that was",
    "a a hurdle for you to overcome? Yes and",
    "no. I think I I dealt with self-doubt in",
    "the sense that, oh, I don't know what",
    "I'm doing and I need to figure it out.",
    "Um, but I didn't doubt myself in the way",
    "of somebody else knows better than me",
    "for me or that, you know, I'm an idiot",
    "or I'm not worthwhile or anything that I",
    "I guess I had the benefit of I grew up",
    "with a lot of love like the people",
    "around me love me unconditionally. And",
    "so that just gave me a lot of",
    "confidence. Uh, not the kind of",
    "confidence that would say I have the",
    "answer, but the kind of confidence that",
    "I will figure it out and I know what I",
    "want or only I am a good arbiter of what",
    "I want. Yeah. That level of self-belief,",
    "I suppose, allows you to determine what",
    "is it that matters to me, my",
    "self-esteem, should I chase this thing",
    "or not? I can make a fair judgment on",
    "that as opposed to being so swayed. But",
    "it's such a good point about even if you",
    "think you're not consciously logging the",
    "stuff that you're doing, there is some",
    "that's in the back of your mind. Was it",
    "the Damon? Is that what the ancient",
    "Greeks or something used to talk about?",
    "Yeah. The Yeah. Also in computer science",
    "like there's a concept of a demon which",
    "is a uh a program that's always running",
    "in the background. You can't see it.",
    "Okay. Um but yeah, it probably comes",
    "from the ancient Greek demon. Uh but",
    "yeah, I what you know that you don't",
    "even know you know is far greater than",
    "what you know you know, right? You can't",
    "even articulate most of the things you",
    "know. There are feelings you have that",
    "have no words for them. There are",
    "thoughts you have that are felt within",
    "the body or subconsciously that you",
    "never articulate to yourself. You don't",
    "really you can't articulate the rules of",
    "grammar yet you exercise them",
    "effortlessly when you speak. So I would",
    "argue that your implicit knowledge and",
    "your knowledge that is unknown to",
    "yourself is far greater than the",
    "knowledge you can articulate and that",
    "you can communicate.",
    "And so at some level you're always",
    "watching yourself. That's what your",
    "consciousness is, right? It's the thing",
    "that's watching everything including",
    "your mind, including your body. M so if",
    "you want to uh have high self-esteem",
    "then earn your own selfrespect.",
    "I had this idea the internal golden",
    "rule. So the golden rule says treat",
    "others the way that you should be",
    "treated. You want to be treated. The",
    "internal golden rule says treat yourself",
    "like others should have treated you and",
    "it was a a repost to maybe people that",
    "didn't grow up with unconditional love.",
    "Yeah. In that way. On the love thing,",
    "one of the interesting things about love",
    "is you can try to remember the feeling",
    "of being loved. So go back to when",
    "someone was in love with you or someone",
    "did love you and like really remember",
    "that feeling like really sit with it and",
    "try to recreate it within yourself and",
    "then go to the feeling of you loving",
    "someone and when you were in love. And",
    "I'm not even talking about romantic love",
    "necessarily. So be a little careful",
    "there. I'm talking more about like love",
    "for it can sometimes get complex if",
    "you're talking about past romantic love,",
    "right? a sibling or a child or something",
    "like that or or a parent and uh think",
    "about when you felt love towards someone",
    "or something. And now which is",
    "better? And I would argue that the",
    "feeling of being in love is actually",
    "more exhilarating than the feeling of",
    "being loved. Being loved is a little",
    "clawing. It's a little too sweet. You",
    "kind of want to push the person away.",
    "It's a little embarrassing. And you know",
    "that if that person is too much into it",
    "that you feel constrained. On the other",
    "hand, the feeling of being in love is",
    "very expansive. It's very open. It",
    "actually makes you a better version of",
    "yourself. It makes you want to be a",
    "better person. And so you can create",
    "love anytime you want. It's just that",
    "craving to receive it. That's the",
    "problem. The most expensive trait is",
    "pride. How come? Oh, that was a recent",
    "one. Uh I I tweeted that just because I",
    "think that uh pride is the enemy of",
    "learning. So when I look at my friends",
    "and colleagues, the ones who are still",
    "stuck in the past and have grown the",
    "least are the ones who were the proudest",
    "because they sort of feel like they",
    "already had the answers and so they",
    "don't want to correct themselves",
    "publicly. And so this goes back to the",
    "fame conversation. You get locked into",
    "something you said. It made you famous.",
    "You're known for that and now you want",
    "to pivot or change. So pride prevents",
    "you from saying I'm wrong. It What's",
    "pride in this context here? It could be",
    "as simple as you're trading stocks and",
    "then you don't admit you were wrong. So",
    "you hang on to a lousy trait. Uh it",
    "could be that you uh made a decision to",
    "uh you know marry someone or move",
    "somewhere or enter a profession, it",
    "doesn't work out and then you don't",
    "admit that you were wrong so you get",
    "stuck in it. Uh it's mostly about",
    "getting trapped in local maxima as",
    "opposed to going back down and climbing",
    "up the mountain again. Mhm. And that's",
    "why it's an expensive trade because you",
    "continue to need to repay it in one form",
    "or another. Yeah. You're you're just",
    "stuck at a suboptimal point. Uh it's",
    "going to cost you money. It's going to",
    "cost you success and time and time. Uh",
    "the great artists always have this",
    "ability to start over. Whether it's Paul",
    "Simon or Madonna or you two and I'm",
    "dating myself a little bit. Um but even",
    "the great entrepreneurs, they're just",
    "always willing to start over. Uh I'm",
    "always struck by the Elon Musk story",
    "where, you know, he uh he did PayPal as",
    "X.com originally. Actually, it was his",
    "his financial institution that got",
    "merged into PayPal. It's good that",
    "you've got the domain. You know what I",
    "mean? Yeah, exactly. I'll park that.",
    "I'll hold on. He's consistent. He's been",
    "using it for quite a while. Um, and he",
    "said something like along the lines of,",
    "uh, I made $200 million from the sale of",
    "PayPal. I put $100 million into SpaceX,",
    "80 million Tesla, 20 into Solar City,",
    "and I had to borrow money for rent.",
    "Right? This guy is a perennial risk",
    "taker. He's always willing to start",
    "over. He doesn't have any pride about",
    "being seen as successful or being seen",
    "as a failure. He's willing to put it all",
    "in. Back himself again each time. Back",
    "himself again each time. But the key",
    "thing is he's always willing to start",
    "over, right? even now when he's sort of",
    "made his his new startup is a USA,",
    "right? He's basically trying to fix it",
    "like he would fix one of his startups.",
    "And I think that is a willingness to",
    "look like a fool and that is a",
    "willingness to start over. And a lot of",
    "people just don't have that. They become",
    "successful or they become rich or they",
    "become famous and that's it. They're",
    "stuck. They don't want to go back to",
    "zero. And creating anything great",
    "requires zero to one. And that means you",
    "go back to zero and that's really",
    "painful and hard to do. Talking about",
    "risk, something I've been thinking about",
    "a lot to do with you. Any moment when",
    "you're not having a good time, when",
    "you're not really happy, you're not",
    "doing anyone any favors. I think lots of",
    "people have",
    "become unusually familiar with suffering",
    "silently in that sort of a way of not",
    "having a high bar for your expectation",
    "for quality of life. Uh yeah, a lot of",
    "it is just you're memeing yourself into",
    "a bad outcome because you think that",
    "somehow suffering is glorious or that it",
    "makes you a better person or you know my",
    "old quip was if you're so smart why",
    "aren't you happy? Why can't you figure",
    "that one out? Um the reality is you can",
    "be smart and happy. There are plenty of",
    "people in human history who are smart",
    "and happy. Uh and I think it just starts",
    "with saying yeah you know what I'm I'm",
    "going to be happy. There was a guy that",
    "I met in Thailand a long time ago and uh",
    "he used to work for Tony Robbins. uh you",
    "know he had a great attitude and uh we",
    "were sitting around and he said you know",
    "uh he said I realized one day that",
    "someone out there had to be the happiest",
    "person in the world like there just that",
    "person just has to exist he said why not",
    "me I'll take on that burden I'll be that",
    "guy and I heard that I was like wow",
    "that's pretty good that's a good frame",
    "right he knew how to reframe things and",
    "so I think a lot of happiness is just a",
    "choice uh in the sense that you make",
    "first you just identify yourself as",
    "actually I'm going be a person that's",
    "going to be happy. I'm going to figure",
    "it out. And you just figure it out along",
    "the way. You're not going to lose your",
    "other predilictions. You're not going to",
    "lose your ambition or your desire for",
    "success. I think a lot of people have",
    "this fear that, oh, if I'm happy, then I",
    "won't want to be successful. No, you'll",
    "just want to do things that are more",
    "aligned with the happy version of you,",
    "and you'll be successful at those",
    "things. And believe me, the happy",
    "version of you is not going to look back",
    "at the unhappy version and say, \"Oh man,",
    "that that guy was going to be more",
    "success. I wish I was him.\" You're",
    "actually trying to be successful so",
    "you'll be happy. That's the whole point.",
    "you have you've gotten it backwards. You",
    "you unlocked one of my trap cards. Um,",
    "one of my favorite insights is that we",
    "sacrifice the thing we want for the",
    "thing that's supposed to get it. So, we",
    "sacrifice happiness in order to be",
    "successful so that when we're finally",
    "sufficiently successful, we can actually",
    "be happy. And if you have some sort of",
    "simultaneous equation and you just sort",
    "of stripped success off from both sides,",
    "the at least in my own life, I have not",
    "found there to be a trade-off. If",
    "anything, I have found that the happier",
    "I get, the more I am going to do the",
    "things that I'm good at and aligned with",
    "and that will make me even happier. And",
    "so, I actually end up more successful,",
    "not less. The aligned with thing is",
    "interesting. Uh, I'm going to try and",
    "put this across as delicately as I can.",
    "I would say from the bit of time that",
    "we'd spent together, you have a really",
    "interesting trait",
    "of holistic selfishness. Uh, you're sort",
    "of prepared to put yourself first. um",
    "you seem largely unfazed by saying or",
    "doing things that might might result in",
    "other people feeling a little bit",
    "awkward if it's truthful for you. Uh",
    "it's like unapologetically",
    "self-prioritizing, I guess. Yeah, I",
    "think everybody is. Uh maybe",
    "unapologetic is the part that's that's",
    "relatively uh rare, but I think",
    "everybody puts themselves first. That's",
    "just human nature. You're you're here",
    "because you survive. You're a separate",
    "organism. That's interesting. I um maybe",
    "but I know we like to virtue signal and",
    "pretend we're doing it for each other.",
    "How many how many times does somebody",
    "say, \"Yeah, of course. I'd love to come",
    "to the wedding.\" They're like, \"I don't",
    "want to be at the [ __ ] wedding.\" How",
    "many times does someone say, \"How are",
    "you doing today?\" And they don't tell",
    "you how many I don't go to weddings. But",
    "this is my point. So I don't think",
    "you're necessarily right with that. I",
    "think that people do I don't think they",
    "put themselves first. I sometimes think",
    "that they they compromise what it is",
    "that they want in order to appease",
    "socially what's in front of them. Yeah.",
    "I just view it as you're wast everyone's",
    "wasting their time on it. Um don't do",
    "something you don't want to do. Why why",
    "are you wasting your time? There's so",
    "little time on this earth. Life goes",
    "fast. What is it? 4,000 weeks. That's",
    "your lifespan. Um and and yes, we hear",
    "that, but we don't remember it. But uh I",
    "guess I'm keenly aware of how little",
    "time I have, so I'm just not going to",
    "waste it. How have you got more",
    "comfortable at",
    "um being the unapologetic self-",
    "prioritizer? Yeah, I've gotten I've",
    "gotten utterly more and more ruthless on",
    "it. Ma mainly, it's that I see or hear",
    "people's freedom and then that liberates",
    "me further. So, I read a uh I read a",
    "blog post by uh P. Mark aka Mark Andre",
    "where he said, \"Don't keep a schedule.\"",
    "And I took that to heart. So, I deleted",
    "my calendar and I don't keep a schedule.",
    "I try to remember it all in my head. If",
    "I can't remember it, I'm not going to",
    "add you here on time. Yeah, exactly. Um",
    "I had to look things up at the last",
    "minute. Uh so but ironically I don't",
    "even know if Mark himself follows that",
    "but he made the correct point. Uh I read",
    "a little story about Jack Dorsey doing",
    "all his business off his uh iPhone and",
    "iPad and not even going into a Mac and I",
    "said okay I want to do that. So I'm",
    "going to operate through text messaging",
    "and not put up my nasty email. Does that",
    "feel like more freedom? It does. Yeah.",
    "Cuz you're on the go. Um so I have a",
    "nasty email autoresponder that says I",
    "don't check email and don't text me",
    "either. Right. If you need to find me,",
    "you'll find me. Obviously, some of this",
    "is a luxury of success, but some of",
    "these habits I adopted long before",
    "actually the hostile email autoresponder",
    "started a long time ago. Um, I used to",
    "own the domain. I let it go. I don't do",
    "coffee.com. I used to reply from that",
    "email uh just so people would get the",
    "point. But I stopped being rude about",
    "it. Now I just ghost. I just disappear.",
    "Um, my wife knows not to ever uh book or",
    "schedule me for anything. Uh, I'm not",
    "expect I'm not expected to go to couples",
    "dinners. I'm not expect to go to",
    "birthdays. I'm not expect to go to",
    "weddings. If somebody tries to rope her",
    "into having me show up, she says he",
    "makes his own decisions. You got to ask",
    "him directly. What about vice versa?",
    "Well, are you not killing serendipity in",
    "a way that No, no. I'm freeing up all my",
    "time. So, my entire life is serendipity.",
    "I get to interact with whoever I want,",
    "whenever I want, wherever. You'll hear",
    "the invite, but make the decision",
    "because if you're if there's fewer",
    "things in coming, you're assuming that",
    "you know what's best for you to anything",
    "in the future. So, I'll say, \"Okay, if",
    "that thing is interesting, I'll see if I",
    "can get in that day when I'm in the",
    "mood.\" But there's nothing worse than",
    "something coming up that your past self",
    "committed you to that your present self",
    "doesn't want to do. God damn it. Past.",
    "Yeah. And then it destroys your entire",
    "calendar. It destroys your your day",
    "because there's like, oh, this 1 hour",
    "slot which is sitting like a turd on my",
    "calendar that I have to like schedule my",
    "whole day around. I can't do anything",
    "the 20 minutes before, the 20 minutes",
    "afterwards. Even for phone calls, if",
    "someone wants to do a phone call, say,",
    "\"Okay, just text me when you're free.",
    "I'll text you when I'm free.\" and we'll",
    "just do it on the fly. It's a much",
    "better way of living than this overly",
    "scheduled uh you know cal.com or iical",
    "whatever. The uh the overscheduled life",
    "is not worth living. It's not. I think",
    "it's a terrible way to live life. That's",
    "not how we evolved. It's not how we grew",
    "up. Um it's not how how we were as",
    "children hopefully uh unless you're a",
    "helicopter parent or a tiger mom. Um",
    "your natural order is freedom. Uh I had",
    "a friend who uh said to me once, you",
    "know, uh I never want to have to be at a",
    "specific place at a specific time. And I",
    "was like, \"Oh my god, that's freedom.\"",
    "When I heard that, that changed my life",
    "right there. You still arm alarm",
    "clockless? Yes, I'm alarm clockless.",
    "Today, I did set my alarm clock just so",
    "I wouldn't miss this. Very important.",
    "Yeah. If you still, but just so you",
    "know, I set the alarm clock from 11:00",
    "a.m. in case I was stricken with a flu",
    "that day. I wasn't going to set my alarm",
    "clock for 8:00 a.m. or 9:00 a.m. And",
    "sure enough, I got up many hours before",
    "that. Um, but it was sort of a backup",
    "emergency alarm. In fact, sometimes when",
    "I something that I need to do, I don't",
    "want to look at a calendar, so I'll just",
    "set an alarm for it.",
    "Just sink a little bit more into",
    "that like kind of like that [ __ ] you",
    "energy, that self- prioritizing energy",
    "because I think people rationally love",
    "the idea of this. I'm going to do what",
    "only I want to do. uh even if they've",
    "got the level of freedom, it's not [ __ ]",
    "you energy in the sense that I think",
    "everyone should live their life that way",
    "to the greatest extent possible.",
    "Obviously, we have our requirements",
    "around work and obligations that are",
    "genuinely important to us. But don't",
    "fritter away your life on randomly",
    "scheduled things and things that aren't",
    "important don't matter and events and",
    "weddings and you know tedious dinners",
    "with tedious people that you don't want",
    "to go to. To the extent you can bring",
    "freedom into your life, optimize for",
    "that, you'll actually be more",
    "productive. You won't just be happier",
    "and more free. You will be more",
    "productive because then you can focus on",
    "what is in front of you, whatever the",
    "biggest problem of that day. When I wake",
    "up in the morning, uh the first 4 hours",
    "are when I have the most energy and",
    "that's when I want to solve all the hard",
    "problems. And the next 4 hours are when",
    "I kind of want to, you know, do some",
    "more outdoorsy activities or I want to",
    "work out or maybe I can, you know, have",
    "some meetings, but I'll try to do those",
    "last second based on whatever the day's",
    "priorities demand. the last 4 hours I",
    "kind of want to wind down. I want to",
    "hang out with the kids and I want to",
    "play games or read a book or something",
    "like that. So having that flexibility",
    "and freedom is really important. So you",
    "can just put whatever is most needed",
    "into the slot at that moment. Uh and",
    "instead if I have like a meeting at 2",
    "p.m. and then I have to like get a thing",
    "and some emails done, I put that off",
    "till 6 p.m. I'm rushing. I'm not going",
    "to be productive. I'm not going to be uh",
    "You're certainly not free. You're not",
    "I'm definitely not free. But also",
    "another thing that I really believe is",
    "that inspiration is perishable. Act on",
    "it immediately. So when you're inspired",
    "to do something, do that thing. If I'm",
    "inspired to write a blog post, I want to",
    "do it at that moment. If I'm inspired to",
    "send a tweet, I want to do it at that",
    "moment. If I'm inspired to solve a",
    "problem, I do it that moment. If I'm",
    "inspired to read a book, I want to read",
    "it right then. If I'm inspired to solve",
    "a problem, I solve it right there. If I",
    "want to learn something, I I do it at",
    "the moment of curiosity. The moment the",
    "curiosity arrives, I go learn that thing",
    "immediately. I download the book. I get",
    "on Google. I get on ChatGpt, whatever. I",
    "will figure that thing out on the spot",
    "and that's when the learning happens. It",
    "doesn't happen because I've scheduled",
    "time because I've set an hour aside",
    "because when that time arrives I might",
    "be in a different mood. I might just",
    "want to do something different. So I",
    "think that spontaneity is really",
    "important. You're going to learn best",
    "when you're having fun when you",
    "generally are enjoying the process not",
    "when you're forced to sit there and do",
    "it. How much do you remember from",
    "school? You know you were forced to",
    "learn geography, history, mathematics on",
    "this schedule at this time according to",
    "this person. Didn't happen. All the",
    "stuff that sticks with you is you",
    "learned it when you wanted to, when you",
    "genuinely had the desire. And that",
    "freedom, that ability to act on",
    "something the moment you want to is so",
    "liberating that most of us go through",
    "our lives with very very little tastes",
    "of that. If you live your entire life",
    "that way, that is a recipe for",
    "happiness. It feels like efficiency that",
    "that you have efficient also. You have",
    "the inspiration that is going to be the",
    "most frictionless time to ever do that",
    "particular task. So, oh, I've had the",
    "inspiration to do that. I'll put that",
    "off until a time when I no longer really",
    "want to do it quite so much. And while I",
    "do want to do that thing, I'll do",
    "something else that I needed to do",
    "because it's on the schedule. It does",
    "not work. Procrastination is because you",
    "don't want to do that thing right now.",
    "You want to do something else. Go do",
    "that something else. I reject this frame",
    "that efficiency and productivity and",
    "success are counter to happiness and",
    "freedom. They actually go together.",
    "How so? The happier you are, the more",
    "you can sustain doing something, the",
    "more likely you're going to do something",
    "that will in turn make you even happier.",
    "and you'll continue to do it and you'll",
    "outwork everybody else. The more free",
    "you are, the better you can allocate",
    "your time and the less you're caught up",
    "in a web of obligations and commitments",
    "and the more you can focus on the task",
    "at hand. In other news, this episode is",
    "brought to you by Function. Staying on",
    "top of your health requires more than",
    "just an annual physical, which is why I",
    "partnered with Function. They run lab",
    "tests twice a year to track over a 100",
    "biomarkers and monitor for early signs",
    "of thousands of diseases. They even",
    "screen for 50 types of cancer at stage",
    "one, which is five times more data than",
    "you get from an annual physical. You",
    "receive insights from a team of expert",
    "physicians who provide a detailed",
    "written clinician summary of all their",
    "observations and then phone",
    "consultations for any critical findings.",
    "Getting these lab tests done would",
    "usually cost thousands, but with",
    "function, it is only",
    "$499. And right now, you can get the",
    "exact same blood panels that I get and",
    "bypass their weight list by going to the",
    "link in the description below or heading",
    "to",
    "functionhealth.com/modernwisdom. That's",
    "functionhealth.com/modernwisdism. This",
    "is related to another insight of yours.",
    "The less you want something, the less",
    "you're thinking about it. The less",
    "you're obsessing over it, the more",
    "you're going to do it in a natural way,",
    "the more you're going to do it for",
    "yourself. You're going to do it in a way",
    "that you're good at and you're going to",
    "stick with it. The people around you",
    "will see the quality of your work is",
    "higher. But this seems like a difficult",
    "tension to navigate because an obsessive",
    "attention to detail is a competitive",
    "advantage of your work as well. So you",
    "have these two things sort of",
    "conflicting with each other. No one is",
    "going to beat you at being you if it So",
    "one of the things I like to say is like",
    "find what feels like play to you but",
    "looks like work to others. So it looks",
    "like work to them but to you it feels",
    "like play. It's not work. So you're",
    "going to out compete them because you're",
    "doing it effortlessly. You're doing it",
    "for fun. They're doing it for work.",
    "They're doing it for some byproduct. To",
    "you it's art. It's beauty. It's joy.",
    "It's it's flow. It's fulfilling. Uh, you",
    "must enjoy podcasting. If you didn't,",
    "you wouldn't be good at",
    "it either, right? If you would, you",
    "would if if you decided that the right",
    "way to get ahead in life was to go write",
    "books. You would, nobody would have",
    "heard of you. Chris Williamson's book",
    "would be a complete flop. That's not who",
    "you are. You're a podcaster. You enjoy",
    "talking to people. You enjoy",
    "interviewing them. The more you do",
    "things that are natural to you, the less",
    "competition you have. You escape",
    "competition through authenticity.",
    "by being your own self. If I had to",
    "summarize how to be successful in life",
    "in two words, I would just say",
    "productize yourself. That's it. Just",
    "figure out what it is that you naturally",
    "do that the world might want that you",
    "can scale up and turn into a product and",
    "it'll be it'll eventually be effortless",
    "for you. Yes, there's always work",
    "required, but it won't even feel like",
    "work to you. It'll feel like play to",
    "you. And modern society gives us that",
    "opportunity. You know, if you were 2,000",
    "years ago, you're born in a farm. Your",
    "choices are very limited, right? You're",
    "going to do stuff on that farm. Now, you",
    "can literally wake up and you can move",
    "to a different city. You can switch",
    "careers. You can switch jobs. You can",
    "change the people that you're with. Uh,",
    "you know, you can change so many things",
    "about who you are and who you're with",
    "and what you're doing that there is",
    "infinite opportunity out there for you.",
    "Literally infinite. And so it's much",
    "better to treat this like a search",
    "function to find the people who need you",
    "the most, to find the work that needs",
    "you the most, to find the place you're",
    "best suited to be at. And it's",
    "worthwhile to spend time in that",
    "exploration before diving into",
    "exploitation. The biggest mistake in a",
    "world with so many choices is premature",
    "commitment. If you prematurely commit to",
    "being a lawyer or a doctor and now",
    "you've got like, you know, 5 years",
    "invested into that, you might have just",
    "completely missed. You might just end up",
    "in the wrong profession, the wrong",
    "place, or the wrong people for 30 years",
    "of your life grinding away. And yes, the",
    "best time to figure that out was before,",
    "but the second best time is now. So,",
    "just change it. And also, presumably",
    "kill things that aren't working very",
    "quickly.",
    "By default, you should kill everything.",
    "You know, if you can't decide, the",
    "answer is no. Uh, and most things you",
    "should just be saying no to. The part of",
    "my keeping my calendar free is just by",
    "default saying no to everything. Do I",
    "want to create a calendar just to add",
    "your event, right? Or to add your need",
    "or your desire. One of the other things",
    "about, you know, early on in life,",
    "you're looking for opportunities. So,",
    "you're saying yes to everything. And",
    "that is a phase that you go through.",
    "That is the exploration phase. Later,",
    "when you found the thing you want to",
    "work on, you're in the exploitation",
    "phase. You have to say no to everything",
    "by default. And if you don't say no to",
    "everything by default, if you have to",
    "even explicitly go out of your way to",
    "say no to something, that will take up",
    "time. Uh, for example, you know, there",
    "there are a lot of people out there who",
    "are into hustle culture and and a big",
    "piece of hustle culture is like, well,",
    "you're not going to get something if you",
    "don't ask for it. So, they'll hustle",
    "people. They'll always be sending you",
    "requests, messages. Yeah, this is a",
    "famous person problem, but I have it.",
    "And people are always asking me for",
    "things. And I kind of squirm when I get",
    "these messages, and I'm sure you get",
    "these two text messages, emails saying,",
    "\"Hey, Chris, my friend so and so should",
    "really be on your podcast, or you should",
    "come to my event. You should write a",
    "forward for my book.\" And you kind of",
    "squirm when you get this, right? You",
    "have to figure out how to say no. And",
    "one of the things I learned along the",
    "way is that if you wouldn't ask somebody",
    "else to do it and then you get that",
    "request yourself, you can just dismiss",
    "it. You don't have to respond. You don't",
    "you don't even let let it enter your",
    "brain. You have to be able to delete",
    "emails and text messages without",
    "flinching if you want to scale. And",
    "scaling is very important. Scaling your",
    "time is really important. Every",
    "interruption will take you out of flow.",
    "So the only way you can remain in flow",
    "is if you get either very good at",
    "ignoring these things by default or",
    "closing yourself off like a hermit like",
    "our mutual friend Tim Ferris does or you",
    "just become emotionally capable of not",
    "registering these as something that",
    "causes turbulence inside of you. That",
    "not registering it emotionally thing is",
    "that uh it's fundamental. That's so",
    "fundamental to so many things in life.",
    "Okay. Can we dig into that a little bit?",
    "is because again I've only seen you as",
    "you right I didn't know you 20 years ago",
    "I didn't know you as a child um so I've",
    "only seen you with",
    "this holistic selfishness the in",
    "integrated self- prioritization whatever",
    "we I don't know what we called it",
    "selfish is fine I'll take selfish I'm",
    "selfish I'm very selfish person don't",
    "contact me",
    "uh yeah that emotional reaction I also",
    "get the sense too that maybe people have",
    "lived obligation life for so long that",
    "they actually kind of struggle to tap",
    "into what it is that they want. They've",
    "hidden their wants and their desires and",
    "their needs and they've dep prioritized",
    "themselves so much for so long they go,",
    "\"What do I want actually? What what is",
    "it? Do I want to go to this thing or",
    "not?\" Because all I've done is be",
    "[ __ ] puppeted, right? I've been",
    "marionetted by other people's desires",
    "for so so so long. I can't even tap into",
    "that anymore. And saying no feels like a",
    "war crime. So, so I think it's really",
    "good to be able to view your own mind",
    "and your own thoughts objectively and",
    "that is the big benefit of meditation.",
    "It creates a small gap between your",
    "conscious observation self and your mind",
    "and that lets you then look at your",
    "thoughts and evaluate them a little bit",
    "like you would a third party's",
    "statements. And uh if you just take your",
    "mind to be you and they're integrated in",
    "one and the same at all times and you're",
    "reacting from the mind, then you're not",
    "even going to question things that come",
    "into your mind. Anything that comes in",
    "that creates a reaction will immediately",
    "create a reaction. But if you can",
    "observe your thoughts a little bit and",
    "not in some woo way, but you can even",
    "just do it through therapy, you can do",
    "it through journaling, you can do it any",
    "way you would like, you can just take",
    "long walks, you don't have to meditate",
    "and do lotus position. uh all that is",
    "unnecessary. But if you can observe your",
    "own thoughts and view them a little",
    "objectively, then you can start being uh",
    "a little more choosy, a little more",
    "critical and you can realize that there",
    "are no problems in the real world other",
    "than maybe things that inflict pain on",
    "your body. Everything else has to become",
    "a problem in your mind first. You have",
    "to view it and interpret it and create a",
    "narrative that it is a problem before it",
    "becomes a problem. And then you realize",
    "that a lot of your emotional energy is",
    "spent on reacting to things that your",
    "mind is automatically saying are",
    "problems. Uh and you don't need all",
    "those problems. Do you really need that",
    "many problems in your life? Again, I",
    "would say try to focus on just one",
    "overarching problem and then go solve",
    "that problem. It's like if you want to",
    "be successful, define success very",
    "concretely. Focus on that. In everything",
    "else, when it enters your mind, it",
    "becomes a problem. Whether it's a",
    "judgment about the girl walking down the",
    "street or the car that just cut in front",
    "of you or whether it's like you know",
    "this your accountant did this stupid",
    "thing like yes it's going to trigger you",
    "but observe for a moment that like it's",
    "triggering me. I've created a problem.",
    "Do I really want to have this problem",
    "right now? Do I want to spend the energy",
    "on this problem or do I want that going",
    "somewhere else? And it it doesn't have",
    "to be that overt. You don't have to the",
    "mind mud wrestling with itself is also a",
    "problem but because it loves to do that.",
    "I have my problems have got problems and",
    "I have a real problem about fixing my",
    "problems. Yeah. Exactly. So you just",
    "you're going to be much happier and much",
    "more focused. Again, I think happiness",
    "and focus and success can kind of",
    "complement each other. You're going to",
    "have much more energy. Just think about",
    "as mental energy. You have much more",
    "mental energy to focus on the actual",
    "problems you want to solve if you don't",
    "start unconsciously, subconsciously,",
    "reactively picking up problems",
    "everywhere. So before anything can be a",
    "problem that takes up your emotional",
    "energy, you have to accept it as a",
    "problem. You can be choosy about your",
    "problems. And I'm not saying I'm perfect",
    "in that regard, but I think I'm better",
    "than I used to be. Well, lots of people",
    "are addicted to solving problems. So",
    "much so that sometimes people create",
    "problems when we don't have any simply",
    "so that we can solve them. We have that",
    "going on. And then even worse is we take",
    "on problems that we can't affect. So,",
    "uh, you know, another one of my little",
    "quips was, uh, you know, um, a rational",
    "person, uh, can, uh, sort of a rational",
    "person should should cultivate",
    "indifference to things that are out of",
    "their control, right? Uh, or a rational",
    "person can find peace by cultivating",
    "indifference to things that are out of",
    "their control. Uh, and I'm as guilty as",
    "anybody of doom surfing on X or social",
    "media and getting worked up about things",
    "that I can't do anything about, right?",
    "like, do I want to be fighting those",
    "battles in my mind when I literally",
    "cannot do anything about it? So, if you",
    "find yourself looping on a problem, like",
    "you're watching the news too much and",
    "you're getting caught up in a problem",
    "you can't do anything about, um, you",
    "have to step away from that. And, uh,",
    "modern media is a delivery mechanism for",
    "mimetic viruses. And now, what's",
    "happened now is, you know, 100 years",
    "ago, 500 years ago, if something wasn't",
    "happening in your immediate vicinity,",
    "you wouldn't hear about it. it wouldn't",
    "be a problem for you. But now every",
    "single one of the world's problems has",
    "turned into a mimemetic virus which is",
    "going into the battlefield of the news",
    "and is trying to infect your mind in",
    "real time so that yeah so that you",
    "become obsessed with the war in Ukraine",
    "which is really far away or you get",
    "obsessed with climate change or you get",
    "obsessed with AI doom or you get",
    "obsessed with whatever and there's",
    "nothing as riveting as the old religion",
    "the world is ending the world is ending",
    "pay attention the world is ending and if",
    "you don't Cassandra complex at global",
    "scale Cassandra complex at global scale",
    "Well, and I would argue that large",
    "percentages of the population are",
    "essentially just infected with these",
    "mimetic viruses that have taken over",
    "their brain and are causing them to do",
    "incredible girration about things that",
    "probably aren't even true or are greatly",
    "exaggerated. But even to the extent they",
    "are true, they're things that that",
    "person can do nothing about. And they",
    "should put their own house in order",
    "first. So, you know, another little line",
    "I have for myself is your family is",
    "broken, but you're going to fix the",
    "world. Right? People are running out",
    "there to try and fix the world when",
    "their own lives are a mess. Oh my god.",
    "Right? And and I think it defies",
    "credibility if you can't fix your own",
    "life first. I'm not going to take you",
    "seriously if you can't fix your own",
    "life. Like all these philosophers who,",
    "you know, seem like people you emulate",
    "and so smart or like these brilliant",
    "celebrities and they go off and commit",
    "suicide. Well, you just kind of",
    "invalidated your whole way of life. It's",
    "like that line of in No Country for All",
    "Men where the killer is waiting for the",
    "protagonist and protagonist shows up and",
    "the killer says, \"Well, you know, if",
    "your set of rules brought you here, then",
    "what good are your rules?\" I didn't",
    "work. Um I I I I am self I'm",
    "holistically selfish in in that I want",
    "to be objectively successful in",
    "everything I set out to want. Mhm. Yeah.",
    "Uh you have one life. Don't settle for",
    "mediocrity. Don't settle for mediocrity.",
    "And and I think the only like people",
    "debate intelligence for example, right?",
    "We talk about IQ tests and all that, but",
    "I think the only true test of",
    "intelligence is if you get what you want",
    "out of life. And there are two parts to",
    "that. One is getting what you want so",
    "you know how to get it. And the second",
    "is wanting the right things. Knowing",
    "what to want in the first place. I could",
    "want to be a, you know, 6'8 basketball",
    "player and I'm not going to get that. So",
    "it's wanting the wrong thing. So that's",
    "wanting something that you can't get.",
    "That's wanting something you can't get.",
    "Is also wanting something that you don't",
    "want. Yeah. Wanting something that's a",
    "booby prize. There are plenty of booby",
    "prizes out there, too. Right. I haven't",
    "heard that word in about 20 years. Yeah.",
    "Prizes that are just not worth having or",
    "that create their own problems. Well, if",
    "you're not careful, you can end up in a",
    "place in life not only that you don't",
    "want to be, but one that you didn't even",
    "mean to get to. That's if you're kind of",
    "proceeding unconsciously. Uh how many",
    "people and and usually I think people",
    "end up there because they are uh going",
    "on autopilot with sort of societal",
    "expectations or other people's",
    "expectations. So, uh you know, or out of",
    "guilt or out of like uh mimemetic",
    "desire. You know, Peter Teal has this",
    "whole thing from Rene Gerard about how",
    "mimemetic desires are desires are picked",
    "up from other people. Uh, and some of",
    "those are automatically baked into",
    "society like, you know, go to law",
    "school, go to med school, go to",
    "whatever, go to business school. Um, or",
    "they might be from watching what your",
    "friends are doing and, you know, the",
    "other monkeys are doing. Um, or it might",
    "just be, you know, what your parents",
    "expectations are. I might be a guilt.",
    "You know, guilt is just society's voice",
    "speaking in your head, socially",
    "programmed, so you'll be a good little",
    "monkey and do things that are good for",
    "the tribe. Um, but I think the the the",
    "best outcomes come when you think it",
    "through for yourself and decide for",
    "yourself. And I don't think people spend",
    "enough time deciding. For example, we",
    "run on these uh four-year cycles. You",
    "know, in Silicon Valley, you go join a",
    "startup, you vest your stock over four",
    "years. That's the standard. Okay? Um uh",
    "in u uh college, you know, you go for",
    "four years. High school, you go for four",
    "years. Um some things take longer. You",
    "know, you have children, they hit",
    "puberty 9 years later. That's like a",
    "9-year cycle until that relationship",
    "changes. Um but we're used to these",
    "fairly long cycles, multi-year cycles in",
    "which we are committed to things. You go",
    "to law school, you know, four or five",
    "year cycle. You go be a lawyer, 40-year",
    "cycle. These are very long cycles. The",
    "amount of time we spend deciding what to",
    "do and who to do it with, very short,",
    "very very short, right? We spend, you",
    "know, 3 months deciding, one month",
    "deciding on a job where we're going to",
    "be for 10 years or 5 years. And because",
    "a lot of discovery is path dependent",
    "where the next thing you find on the",
    "path is depend on where you were on the",
    "previous path. You sort of start going",
    "down this vector that is a very long",
    "distance. People decide frivolously",
    "which city to live in and that's going",
    "to decide who their friends are, what",
    "their jobs are, their opportunity, their",
    "weather, their food supply, their air",
    "supply, quality of life. You know, it's",
    "such an important decision, but people",
    "spend so little time thinking it",
    "through. I would argue that if you're",
    "making a four-year decision, spend a",
    "year thinking it through. Like really",
    "thinking it through. 25% of the time.",
    "Yeah. Exactly. There's the secretary",
    "theorem. I don't know if you know that",
    "one. Computer science. After you've done",
    "this many people, pick the best one of",
    "the next however many. That's right.",
    "Yeah. The secretary theorem is this",
    "computer science professor is trying to",
    "figure out uh how much time he should",
    "spend interviewing secretaries and then",
    "how long to keep the secretary. So let's",
    "say he's going to have a secretary for",
    "10 years. Does he keep searching for,",
    "you know, one year, 2 years, 3 years, 1",
    "month, 2 months? What is the optimal",
    "time? Uh and it turns out that the",
    "optimal time is somewhere around a",
    "third. about a third of the way through,",
    "you take the best person you've worked",
    "with and try to find someone that good",
    "or better. So that by the time you've",
    "gotten about a third of the way through,",
    "you have, excuse me, seen enough that",
    "you now have a sense of what the bar is.",
    "And then anybody who meets or exceeds",
    "that bar is good enough. And this",
    "applies to dating, this applies to jobs",
    "and careers, this applies generally. But",
    "the interesting thing about the",
    "secretary theorem is that it's actually",
    "not time based. It's not based on",
    "onethird of the time. It's iteration",
    "based. The number of candidates, the",
    "number of shots you took on goal. That's",
    "right. So, you want to have lots and",
    "lots of iterations. So, that means that",
    "you need to bail out quickly and you",
    "need to be decisive quickly. That's",
    "right. You need to you need to take",
    "opportunities quickly and bail out",
    "quickly. Correct. Like if you go back",
    "and you look through failed",
    "relationships, uh probably the biggest",
    "regret will be staying in the",
    "relationship after you knew it was over.",
    "Exactly. You should have left sooner.",
    "The moment you knew it wasn't going to",
    "work out, you should have moved on. So",
    "in that sense, I think Malcolm Gladwell",
    "popularized this idea of 10,000 hours to",
    "mastery. I would say it's actually",
    "10,000 iterations to mastery. It's not",
    "actually 10,000. It's some unknown",
    "number. But it's about the number of",
    "iterations that drives a learning curve.",
    "And iteration is not repetition.",
    "Repetition is a different thing.",
    "Repeating is doing the same thing over",
    "and over. Iteration is modifying it with",
    "a learning and then doing another",
    "version of it. So that's error",
    "correction. So if you get 10,000 error",
    "corrections in anything, you will be an",
    "expert at it. don't partner with cynics",
    "and pessimists. You mentioned there",
    "about uh the people who've got a",
    "nightmare going on at home and are",
    "trying to fix the world. But a lot of",
    "the time that cynicism and pessimism we",
    "find in ourselves. We see the world",
    "whether we want to whether it's because",
    "we've embied what the news or or the",
    "negative people around us have said or",
    "it's a bit more kind of endogenous than",
    "that. It's just sort of in us. It's the",
    "way that we see the world. How can",
    "people avoid cynicism and pessimism",
    "within themselves? Yeah. Synism and",
    "pessimism is a tough one. It's we're",
    "naturally hardwired for it. Again, I go",
    "back to evolution. I I'm sorry to keep",
    "harping on evolution, but within",
    "biology, there's very few good",
    "explanatory theories. And you know,",
    "theory of evolution by natural selection",
    "is probably the best one. So, if you",
    "can't explain something about life or",
    "psychology or human nature through",
    "evolution, then you probably don't have",
    "a good theory for it. And I would say",
    "that pessimism is another one that comes",
    "out of this, which is in the natural",
    "environment, you're hardwired to be",
    "pessimistic. Because let's say that I",
    "see something rustling in the woods and",
    "if I move towards it and it turns out to",
    "be food and prey then good I get to eat",
    "one meal but if it turns out to be a",
    "predator I get eaten and that's the end",
    "of that. So we are hardwired to avoid",
    "ruin um and and uh you know just dying.",
    "So we are naturally hardwired to be",
    "pessimists but modern society is very",
    "different despite whatever problems you",
    "may have with modern society. It is far",
    "far safer than living in the jungle and",
    "just trying to survive. uh and the",
    "opportunities on the upside are",
    "nonlinear. For example, when you're",
    "investing, if you short a stock, you the",
    "most money you can make is 2x. You just",
    "lose. You know, if the stock goes to",
    "zero, you double your money. But if the",
    "stock is the next Nvidia and it goes",
    "100x or a,000x, you make a lot of money.",
    "So upside through because of leverage is",
    "nearly unlimited. Uh also in modern",
    "society, because there's so many",
    "different people you can interact with,",
    "if you go on a date and it fails, there",
    "are infinite more people to go on a date",
    "with. In a tribal system, there might",
    "have been 20 people and you can't even",
    "get through all of them. So, modern",
    "society is far more forgiving of",
    "failure. And you just have to sort of",
    "neoccortically realize and override",
    "that. You have to realize that you're",
    "much more running a search function to",
    "find the thing that'll work. And then",
    "that one thing will pay off in massive",
    "compounding. Once you find your mate for",
    "the rest of your life, you find your",
    "wife or your husband, then you can",
    "compound in that relationship. It's okay",
    "if you had 50 failed dates in between.",
    "The same way once you find the one",
    "business you're meant to plow into and",
    "it'll compound returns. It's okay if you",
    "had 50 small failed ventures or 50 small",
    "failed job interviews. It doesn't the",
    "number of failures doesn't matter. And",
    "so there's no point in being a",
    "pessimist. It's you want to be an",
    "optimist. But I would say you want to be",
    "you want to be skeptical about specific",
    "things. Every specific opportunity is",
    "probably a fail. But you want to be",
    "optimistic in the general. In the",
    "general you want to be like something in",
    "here is going to work out. How do you",
    "navigate that tension?",
    "I mean, exactly as I said, I'm",
    "optimistic in the general that if",
    "something fails right now, then this is",
    "a little woowoo, but it wasn't meant to",
    "be. It was a learning experience. It was",
    "an iteration. As long as I learned",
    "something from it, then it's a win. If I",
    "didn't learn from it, then it's a loss.",
    "But as long as you're learning and you",
    "keep iterating fast and cutting your",
    "losses quickly, then when you find the",
    "right thing, you have to be optimistic",
    "and compound into it. So, you don't want",
    "to jump into the first thing. And you",
    "don't want to marry the first person you",
    "date necessarily, unless you got very",
    "lucky. Um, but you you want to",
    "investigate and explore very very",
    "quickly until you find the match. And",
    "then you have to be willing to go all",
    "in. You have to be willing to move your",
    "chips to the center of the table. So",
    "both those uh both those uh approaches",
    "are required. So it's a barbell",
    "strategy. It's sort of black or it's",
    "white. And most people are sort of stuck",
    "in this gray bit. And I'm like half in,",
    "but I'm kind of don't really know if I",
    "am. I also think like labels like",
    "pessimist, optimist, cynic, introvert,",
    "extrovert, these are very self-limiting.",
    "Humans are very dynamic. There are times",
    "when you feel like being introverted.",
    "There are times when you feel like being",
    "extroverted. There are contexts in which",
    "you'll be pessimistic. There are",
    "contexts in which you'll be",
    "optimistic. Leave all those labels",
    "alone. It's better just to look at the",
    "problem at hand. Look at reality the way",
    "it is. Try to take yourself out of the",
    "equation in a in a sense. Like obviously",
    "you're involved, but motivated reasoning",
    "is the worst kind of reasoning. Uh",
    "you're not going to find truth through",
    "highly motivated reasoning. You have to",
    "be objective. And objective means trying",
    "to take yourself out of it as much as",
    "possible or at least your personality",
    "out of it as much as possible. And so to",
    "the extent you run with this thick",
    "identity and personality, it's going to",
    "cloud your judgment. It's going to try",
    "and lock you into the past. If you say,",
    "\"I'm a depressed, unhappy person. Yeah,",
    "I'm going to be unhappy.\" That's a way",
    "of locking yourself into your past. even",
    "saying, \"I have trauma. I have PTSD.\"",
    "Yeah, you you feel something. There are",
    "memories. There are flashes. There are",
    "occasional bad feelings. But don't",
    "define yourself by it because then",
    "you'll lock it into your identity and",
    "you're just going to loop on it. It's",
    "better to stay flexible because reality",
    "is always changing and you have to be",
    "able to adapt to it. Adaptation is also",
    "intelligence. Adaptation is survival.",
    "Adaptation is kind of how you're here.",
    "You're here because you're an adapter",
    "and your ancestors were adapters. So to",
    "adapt, you will be able to see things",
    "clearly. And if you're seeing them",
    "through your own identity, it's going to",
    "cloud your judgment. A quick aside,",
    "you've probably heard me talk about",
    "Element before. In fact, you might be",
    "thinking, \"For sake, Chris, will you",
    "shut up about Element?\" And the answer",
    "is no, I won't because when I take it, I",
    "genuinely feel the difference. I",
    "genuinely believe that proper hydration",
    "makes a massive difference to your",
    "performance. So, I'm going to keep",
    "talking about it until you start",
    "drinking it. Element is a tasty",
    "electrolyte drink mix with everything",
    "that you need and nothing that you",
    "don't. Each grab-and-go stick pack",
    "contains a sciencebacked electrolyte",
    "ratio of sodium, potassium, and",
    "magnesium with no sugar, no coloring, no",
    "artificial ingredients, or any other",
    "junk. It plays a critical role in",
    "reducing muscle cramps and fatigue while",
    "optimizing brain health, regulating",
    "appetite, and curbing cravings. This",
    "orange flavor in a cold glass of water",
    "is how I've started my morning every",
    "single day for over 3 years now, and I",
    "genuinely feel the difference versus",
    "when I don't. Best of all, they have a",
    "no questions asked refund policy with an",
    "unlimited duration. So, you can buy it",
    "and try it for as long as you want. And",
    "if you don't like it for any reason,",
    "they'll just give you your money back.",
    "You don't even need to return the box.",
    "That's how confident they are that you",
    "love it. Plus, they offer free shipping",
    "within the US. And right now, you can",
    "get a free sample pack of all eight",
    "flavors with your first box by going to",
    "the link in the description below or",
    "heading to",
    "drinklnt.com/modernwisdom. That's",
    "drinklnt.com/modern",
    "wisdom. Moving on to sort of thinking",
    "about happiness. Obviously a topic of",
    "yours that's",
    "a it's honestly the one that I feel",
    "least qualified to talk about. Is it",
    "like a guy that's got long arms teaching",
    "you how to bench press or a dude that's",
    "really tall teaching you how to",
    "deadlift? someone that feels like they",
    "came from behind the eightball. Yeah. Is",
    "you're you're asking a crazy person",
    "about their thoughts. So, just thought",
    "it through. Is happiness still more",
    "about peace than it is about",
    "joy? It's just one of those overloaded",
    "words that means different things to",
    "different people. So, I'm not even sure",
    "we're communicating the same language.",
    "But,",
    "uh what is",
    "happiness? I think it's just basically",
    "being okay with where you are.",
    "Not wanting",
    "not wanting things to be different than",
    "the way they are. Not having the sense",
    "that anything is missing in this moment.",
    "Needing something to change. Your",
    "current positive situation being",
    "contingent on an adjustment on getting",
    "something from the outside world.",
    "Ironically, I think most people, if you",
    "were to ask them when they were happiest",
    "for a sustained period of time, not for",
    "a brief moment, because pleasure can",
    "override happiness and create kind of",
    "this illusion of happiness. But if you",
    "ask people when they were happy for a",
    "sustained period of time, they were",
    "probably doing some variation of",
    "nothing.",
    "That's interesting because in the chase",
    "is this sort of lack, this contingency.",
    "That's right. But then you get bored. If",
    "you just sit around all the time, you",
    "get bored. So you want adventure, you",
    "want surprise. Like there's a funny",
    "thought experiment of the bliss machine,",
    "right? Which is suppose I could drill a",
    "hole in your head and put electrode in.",
    "And they did this with monkeys and I can",
    "put a wire in there and I can stimulate",
    "just the right part of your brain and I",
    "can put you in bliss and you'll just be",
    "in bliss. Would you would you want that?",
    "Would that be nice? For how long? Do it",
    "and I'll tell you. Right. So most people",
    "will say, \"Well, I don't want that. I",
    "want meaning. I don't want just bliss. I",
    "want meaning.\" And you're like, \"Okay,",
    "well, I'll put an electrode in there and",
    "I'll give you meaning. How about that?\"",
    "And if you kind of run this thought",
    "experiment long enough, I think most",
    "people realize actually what I want is I",
    "want surprise. I want and I want the",
    "world to surprise me and I want to",
    "wrestle with it in ways that are",
    "somewhat predictable but somewhat not.",
    "And you kind of end up back where you",
    "started. So I I don't know if",
    "necessarily for some people Pure",
    "happiness is the ultimate goal. They",
    "want to, you know, just be blissfully",
    "happy wherever they are, whenever they",
    "are. But I think other people, most",
    "people would say, well, I'm here in this",
    "world. I'm here in this life. I don't",
    "understand it or why, but I want to be I",
    "want to be engaged. I want to be",
    "surprised. I want to do things. I want",
    "to accomplish things. I want to want",
    "things and then get them. Right? That's",
    "kind of the whole game that we're all",
    "playing here. Surprises are really",
    "interesting. the sort of",
    "unpredictability. I think total bro",
    "science here, but I'm pretty sure that",
    "that's kind of how dopamine works. That",
    "things are a bit better than you",
    "expected. That within that it means that",
    "if you for the perennial insecure",
    "overachievers that uh cloy for control",
    "that really want to be able to the",
    "schedule is perfectly done and we know",
    "the itinerary, we know where we're going",
    "to be at this time. you're in some ways",
    "I guess reducing down the capacity for",
    "surprise because everything has become",
    "uh very contrived prescribed done in",
    "advance laid out your ability to be",
    "surprised actually diminishes. Yeah. If",
    "if nothing worked out the way you",
    "expected, if it was all serendipity and",
    "you didn't want that, you would just be",
    "a ball of anxiety. On the other hand, if",
    "everything worked out as you expected",
    "and wanted, you'd be so bored you might",
    "as well be dead. So there's some, you",
    "know, the the river of life kind of",
    "flows between these two banks and enjoy",
    "it. You say thinking about yourself is",
    "the source of all unhappiness, but",
    "presumably you need to work on yourself",
    "and your weaknesses as well. So some",
    "degree of reflection is important. And",
    "if thinking about yourself is a source",
    "of unhappiness, is this a price that you",
    "need to pay? I need to sort of reflect",
    "inward. I'm going to have to diminish",
    "this level of happiness for a little",
    "while and then I can use this new level.",
    "I've got my brown belt on and I can go",
    "out into the world as a brown belt. What",
    "I'm specifically referring to that is if",
    "if you're thinking about your",
    "personality and your ego and the",
    "character of you and uh you're obsessing",
    "over that. That's where a lot of",
    "depression and unhappiness sort of",
    "lingers and and gets cultivated. Uh so",
    "uh thinking about woe is me, this",
    "happened to me. that happened to me. I",
    "have this personality. I have this",
    "issue. I deserve this. I didn't get",
    "that. That's you're just strengthening a",
    "little beast in there that is",
    "insatiable. And that's where I think a",
    "lot of unhappiness comes from. What's",
    "the beast? It's the ego. But that word",
    "is so overused that I kind of hate to",
    "use the word. Um, but it's like a it's a",
    "recurrent collection of thoughts that",
    "are very self-obsessed and will never be",
    "satisfied. Very concretized as well. So,",
    "they're not malleable, not particularly",
    "flexible. So you're just adding to them",
    "by thinking about them all the time.",
    "You're creating narratives and stories",
    "and identities. Um but that's different",
    "from solving personal problems. So if",
    "you encounter something, you learn from",
    "something, you're reflecting upon the",
    "learning, then you can reflect upon it,",
    "absorb it, and then just move on. But",
    "sitting there saying, \"I'm Chris. I'm",
    "Nal. I deserve this. This happened to",
    "me. That person wronged me. This is who",
    "I am. This shouldn't have happened. I",
    "need to go get revenge on this or I need",
    "to fix that or change this.\" I mean that",
    "I think is where a lot of mental illness",
    "is is you know comes from. So it depends",
    "if you are thinking about something to",
    "solve a problem and get it off your",
    "chest and get it off your mind. If it",
    "leaves your mind clearer at the end of",
    "it then I think it was worthwhile. If it",
    "leaves your mind busier at the end of it",
    "then you're probably going the wrong",
    "direction. Is this a a justification",
    "for detachment? Uh cultivated ignorance",
    "uh distraction. Detachment is not a",
    "goal. Detachment is a byproduct. It's",
    "it's just a byproduct of just realizing,",
    "you know, what matters and what doesn't.",
    "Uh and and just for one moment on the",
    "self thing, I think everybody craves",
    "thinking about something more than",
    "themselves. If you want to be you know",
    "happy to some extent you have to forget",
    "about your personal problems and one way",
    "to do that is take on other problems",
    "bigger problems uh and that could be a",
    "mission that could be that could be",
    "spirituality that could be kids um it",
    "could be caring about the planet",
    "although I think people take that a",
    "little far you know and then they get",
    "kind of oppressive and and tyrannical in",
    "support of abstract concepts but so",
    "these can be taken too far just like",
    "religion for example just like anything",
    "in excess anything in excess right um",
    "But generally the less you think about",
    "yourself, the more you can think about a",
    "mission or about God or about a child or",
    "something like that. So I remember",
    "Vinnie Himmath uh the founder of Loom",
    "said uh I am rich and I have no idea to",
    "do what to do with my life and you",
    "replied God kids on mission pick at",
    "least one. That's right. Preferably all",
    "three. It's very liberating.",
    "Um, yeah, thinking I think overthinking",
    "about yourself is probably the it's it",
    "may not be the cause of depression, but",
    "it certainly doesn't help.",
    "Rumination. Yeah,",
    "I I kind of had a self-induced Stockholm",
    "syndrome from this sort of a thing cuz I",
    "like to think about stuff and you",
    "provide you with an endless number of",
    "things to think about. So, you're kind",
    "of Yeah, you have this um you're the",
    "prisoner and the prison guard at the",
    "same time. And I had Abigail Shrier on",
    "the show. She was wrote this book called",
    "Bad Therapy, sort of pushing back",
    "against therapy culture for kids,",
    "specifically for kids. But there was a",
    "blast radius that covered pretty much",
    "everything, including kind of CBT. I'm",
    "like, we're getting perilously close to",
    "some really evidence-based stuff here.",
    "But the more that I've thought about it",
    "and the more that I've looked at the",
    "evidence, there is like basically a",
    "direct correlation between how much you",
    "think about yourself and how miserable",
    "you are. Therapy is great if it lets you",
    "vent and it solves a thing and then x",
    "session later you're done. You're clear.",
    "But if you're just looping on the same",
    "thing forever, then it's actually the",
    "opposite. You're bathing in it. You're",
    "indulging in it. Yeah.",
    "Yeah. How have your become happy",
    "techniques developed over time?",
    "Yeah, I used to have a lot of them. Uh,",
    "now I kind of try not to have any",
    "because I think the techniques",
    "themselves are kind of a struggle. It's",
    "sort of like bidding for status implies",
    "you're low status. It reveals that",
    "you're low status. So, someone who's",
    "basically trying to show off uh comes",
    "across as low status. The same way",
    "someone who's trying to be happy is sort",
    "of saying I'm unhappy and creating that",
    "frame. So it's better just to not even",
    "think in terms of you position yourself",
    "as being in lack in order to attain.",
    "Yeah. I don't even think in terms of",
    "happiness unhappiness anymore. I just",
    "kind of just do my thing. Again another",
    "question that's similar to a bunch of",
    "them. Do you think you could have got",
    "there had you have not done the",
    "procedural systematic sort of step by",
    "step by step this is what it is and then",
    "come out the other side. I don't think",
    "there are any formulas. I think it's",
    "unique to each person. It's like asking",
    "a successful person how did you become",
    "successful? Each one of them will give",
    "you a different story. uh you can't",
    "follow anyone else's path and most of",
    "them are even probably telling you some",
    "narratized version of it that isn't",
    "quite true. I mean that's something that",
    "I continually realize especially as I",
    "get to spend more time around people",
    "that are successful and you hear um it's",
    "very important to prioritize work life",
    "balance right that's one of the most",
    "common things that people who have",
    "attained success say that's not my",
    "experience but if you look at you",
    "shouldn't be asking somebody who is",
    "successful what they do to continue",
    "their success now you should be asking",
    "them what did they do to attain their",
    "success when they are where you were and",
    "the people who are really",
    "extraordinarily successful didn't sit",
    "around watching success",
    "porn. They just went and did it. They",
    "just had they had such an overwhelming",
    "desire to be successful at the thing",
    "that they were doing that they just went",
    "and did that thing. They didn't have",
    "time to study and learn and listen and",
    "they just did it. It's the overwhelming",
    "desire that's the most important and the",
    "focus that comes from that.",
    "that tweet of yours that was uh people",
    "who are good at making wealth or people",
    "who are good at attaining wealth don't",
    "need to teach anybody else how to do it.",
    "Yeah. You don't need mentors, you need",
    "action. That was one of them. Another",
    "one is you know the uh the people who",
    "actually know how to make money don't",
    "need to sell you a course on it. There",
    "is um yeah there's lots of variations on",
    "it. But I if you don't Another one is if",
    "you don't lie awake at night thinking",
    "about it, you don't want it badly",
    "enough.",
    "Yeah. I think you I've heard you talk",
    "before about how um sort of unclosed",
    "loops problems that you're working on",
    "can cause you to be sleepless and uh",
    "this I'm not a good sleeper. Tell me",
    "about that. Oh, I mean my eight sleep",
    "hates me. It's always on me. I failed at",
    "sleeping again. Brian Johnson thinks I'm",
    "going to die early. He's probably right.",
    "But I How much do you reckon you sleep a",
    "night? Have you got any idea? Oh, it's",
    "so random. Some nights I'll sleep 8",
    "hours. Some nights I'll sleep 4 hours.",
    "But it's literally just random. Are you",
    "bothered about that? You trying to",
    "optimize? Are you your sleep coach",
    "teaching you how to I don't fogg myself",
    "over things? Uh if I want to sleep, I'll",
    "sleep. If I don't want to sleep, I don't",
    "sleep. It's not a I don't think I'm",
    "doing anything right or wrong. You don't",
    "label it good night, bad night. No, I",
    "work out every day because I think it",
    "gives me more energy and I've gotten",
    "into a good habit with it. Maybe I'll do",
    "the same thing with sleep. Maybe I'll",
    "develop a good habit, but I'm not going",
    "to beat myself up over it. there'll come",
    "a point where it's important to me and",
    "when it's important to me I'll just do",
    "it you know most of like for example you",
    "look at people with addictions right",
    "overeating or smoking or whatever they",
    "can kind of go through all the different",
    "methods but it's half-hearted and then",
    "one day they're like oh [ __ ] I've got",
    "lung cancer my dad has lung cancer and",
    "they drop it immediately",
    "so I think a lot a lot of change is more",
    "about desire and understanding than it",
    "is about uh forcing yourself or trying",
    "to domesticate yourself it's efficiency",
    "again, I guess, you know, aligning the",
    "thing that you want to do with the way",
    "that you feel about what it is that you",
    "want to do. Yeah. It's not it's not",
    "getting caught up in a in a half desire",
    "or a mimemetic desire. It's really",
    "just being aware of what it is that you",
    "actually want at this point in time. And",
    "when you want something, then you will",
    "act on it with maximal capability. And",
    "that's the time to act on it. In the",
    "meantime, just doing it because other",
    "people tell you you should do it or",
    "society tells you you should do it or",
    "you feel slightly guilty about it. These",
    "are these are half-hearted efforts and",
    "half-hearted efforts don't get you",
    "there. As you get older, one thing that",
    "becomes harder to ignore is your",
    "testosterone levels. They impact",
    "everything",
    "from your energy to your mood and how",
    "well you recover. However, there are",
    "sciencebacked supplements like Tonat",
    "that support testosterone strength and",
    "recovery. And that is why I'm such a",
    "huge fan of Mentis' product because they",
    "make the only NSFcertified Tonkat Ali on",
    "the planet. That means it's so",
    "rigorously tested that even Olympic",
    "athletes can use it and why I partnered",
    "with them because they make the most",
    "carefully tested, highest quality",
    "supplements on Earth. This is a huge",
    "part of my brain, body, and sleep stack,",
    "which makes a big impact on my",
    "cognition, my strength, and my recovery.",

    "checkout. You mentioned anxiety before.",
    "Uh, imagine how effective you'd be if",
    "you weren't anxious all the time is is",
    "one of yours. Anxiety is the emotion",
    "dour of the 21st century. And lots of",
    "driven people, very anxious, very",
    "paranoid. That's what's caused them to",
    "be affected. It pays so much attention,",
    "detail oriented, not letting things go.",
    "Staying up at night thinking about it.",
    "That's the paranoia coming in. What have",
    "you come to learn about anxiety and",
    "dealing with it? So anxiety and stress",
    "are interesting. They're very related.",
    "Stress is when uh like if you look at an",
    "iron beam, when an iron beam is under",
    "stress, it's because it's being bent in",
    "two different directions at the same",
    "time. So when your mind is under stress,",
    "it's because it has two conflicting",
    "desires at once. So for example, you",
    "know, you you want to be liked, but you",
    "want to do something selfish and you",
    "can't reconcile the two and so you're",
    "under stress. Uh you want to do",
    "something for somebody else, you want to",
    "do something for yourself, right? These",
    "are examp you you don't want to go to",
    "work but you want to make money so",
    "you're under stress, right? So you have",
    "two conflicting desires and I think one",
    "of the ways to get through stress is to",
    "acknowledge that oh I actually have two",
    "conflicting desires and either I need to",
    "resolve it. I need to pick one and then",
    "be okay losing the other or I will",
    "decide later. But at least just being",
    "aware of why your stress can help",
    "alleviate a lot of stress. And then",
    "anxiety, I think, is sort of this",
    "pervasive unidentifiable stress where",
    "you're just kind of stressed out all the",
    "time and you're not even sure why and",
    "you can't even identify the underlying",
    "problem. I think the reason for that is",
    "because you you have so many uh",
    "unresolved problems, unresolved stress",
    "points that have piled up in your life",
    "that you can no longer identify what the",
    "problems are. And there's this mountain",
    "of garbage in your mind and a little bit",
    "of it poking out the top like an iceberg",
    "and that's anxiety. But underneath",
    "there's a lot of unresolved things. And",
    "so you just need to kind of go through",
    "very carefully every time you're",
    "anxious. Like, okay, why am I anxious",
    "this time? I don't know why. Oh, well,",
    "let me sit here and just think about it.",
    "Let me let me write down what the",
    "possible causes could be. Let me",
    "meditate on it. Let me journal. Let me",
    "talk to a therapist. Let me talk to my",
    "friends. Let me just kind of see like",
    "when does that stress go away? If you",
    "can kind of identify and unravel and",
    "resolve these issues, then I think that",
    "helps get rid of anxiety. uh a lot of",
    "the anxiety is piled up because we move",
    "through life too quickly not observing",
    "our own reactions to things. We don't",
    "resolve them. So this goes counter to",
    "what I was saying earlier about not",
    "reflecting too much on things. But you",
    "reflect on the problems to observe them",
    "and solve them. You don't reflect on",
    "them to feel better about yourself to",
    "indulge them. Well, if if if you're",
    "doing it to just feel better about",
    "yourself, that could be strengthening",
    "your personality and your ego and could",
    "be creating a more fragile personality.",
    "Um, you know, one one big anxiety",
    "resolver for me is just ruminating on",
    "death. I think that's a good one. You're",
    "going to die. It's all going to zero.",
    "You cannot take anything with you. And I",
    "know this is trit. And I know the the we",
    "don't spend enough time thinking about",
    "the big questions. We kind of give up on",
    "them when we're very, very young. You",
    "know, a little child might ask the big",
    "questions like, why are we here? What's",
    "the meaning of life? What is this all",
    "about? You know, is there Santa Claus?",
    "Is there God? But then as adults, we're",
    "taught not to think about these things",
    "or we've given up on them. But I think",
    "the big questions are the big questions",
    "for good reasons. And uh if you can keep",
    "the idea in front of you at all times",
    "that you're going to die and that",
    "everything goes literally to",
    "zero. What's there to stress about?",
    "Yeah. For better or worse, life is very",
    "short. How should people deal with its",
    "briefness?",
    "Enjoy",
    "it. Make the best of it. You know, it's",
    "it's even briefer than that. Each moment",
    "just disappears. it's gone. There's only",
    "a present moment and it's gone",
    "instantly. So if you're not if you're",
    "not there for it, if you're stressed out",
    "or you're anxious or you're thinking",
    "about something else, you missed it. So",
    "you're any moment when you're not in",
    "that moment, you are dead to that",
    "moment. You might as well be dead",
    "because your mind is off doing something",
    "else or you know living in some imagined",
    "reality that is just a very poor",
    "substitute for the actual reality. So",
    "one of my recent realizations was what",
    "is wasted time? What is a what is a",
    "waste of time? So I don't like to waste",
    "time but what is wasted time? And",
    "everything is wasted time in a sense",
    "because nothing matters in the ultimate.",
    "Uh but in each moment the thing matters.",
    "In each moment it's the only thing that",
    "matters. Actually the what's happening",
    "in front of you is literally has all the",
    "meaning in the world. And so what",
    "matters is just being present for the",
    "thing. So if you're doing something that",
    "you want to do and you're fully there",
    "for it, then it's not wasted time. If",
    "you don't want to do it and your mind is",
    "running away from it and you're reacting",
    "against it and you're wishing you were",
    "somewhere else and you're thinking about",
    "some other thing or you're anticipating",
    "some future thing or regretting some",
    "past thing or being fearful of",
    "something, then that's wasted time.",
    "That's time that's being wasted when",
    "you're not actually present for the",
    "reality in front of you. So my",
    "definition of wasted time, yes I do want",
    "some material things in life and I you",
    "know there there are things that have",
    "more value than others within this life",
    "but this life is very short and bounded.",
    "So the true wasted time is a time that",
    "you're not present for when you are not",
    "there for it. When you're not doing the",
    "thing you want to do to the best of your",
    "capability such that you're immersed in",
    "it. If you're not immersed in this",
    "moment then you're wasting your time.",
    "People get worried about dying and no",
    "longer being here, but they don't",
    "realize that so much of their life is",
    "spent not being here in any case. That's",
    "right. But and I think people crave",
    "being here for it. And and and when",
    "you're here for it, you're actually not",
    "thinking about yourself. You are more",
    "immersed in the thing, the the moment,",
    "the task at hand. We don't want peace of",
    "mind. We want peace for our mind. That's",
    "right. Yeah. You don't peace. The mind",
    "is what can eat you alive if you let it.",
    "And there's more to you than the mind.",
    "How so?",
    "Well, I mean the",
    "very I don't want to disassemble the",
    "body so to speak, right? Because please",
    "go on. Yeah. At the end of the day, like",
    "everything arises within your",
    "consciousness, right? You you got",
    "nowhere else to experience it. Sorry.",
    "You've got nowhere else to experience.",
    "Nowhere else to experience it. And that",
    "consciousness is uh relatively static in",
    "the sense that it's been exactly the",
    "same from the moment you were born to",
    "the moment you die. And everything that",
    "you experience from your body, from your",
    "mind to the world to to everything is",
    "within that consciousness. Uh and that",
    "thing that base layer of being and this",
    "is what the Buddhists will tell you is",
    "the real thing. Everything that comes",
    "and goes in the middle including your",
    "mind, including your body is unreal. And",
    "trying to find stability in those",
    "transient things is is your castle that",
    "you're building on sand that's going to",
    "crumble. Life is going to play out the",
    "way it's going to play out. There will",
    "be some good and some bad. Most of it is",
    "actually just up to your interpretation.",
    "You're born, you have a set of sensory",
    "experiences, and then you die. How you",
    "choose to interpret those experiences is",
    "up to you. And different people",
    "interpret them in different ways. Yeah.",
    "The old line about two people walking",
    "down the street. They're having the",
    "exact same experience. One is h",
    "experience. One is happy, one is sad,",
    "right? It's a narrative in their heads.",
    "It's how they choose to interpret. Um,",
    "so I think when I said that, it was a",
    "long time ago. I was talking more about",
    "having positive interpretations and",
    "negative interpretations. But these",
    "days, I think it's better just not to",
    "have any interpretations and to just",
    "allow things to",
    "be. You're still going to have",
    "interpretations. You can't stop it. Uh",
    "and nor should you try. But even that",
    "having an interpretation is just a thing",
    "you can leave alone.",
    "Yeah. I really want to try and just dig",
    "in a little more to the best way to",
    "remind people that they should value",
    "their time. just how brief it is that",
    "the time that you spend ruminating,",
    "being distracted, fears of the past,",
    "regrets.",
    "Well, I don't want to tell anybody how",
    "to live their life. I would just say",
    "that to the extent that you want to",
    "improve your quality of life, the uh the",
    "easiest and best way to do that is to",
    "observe your own mind and your own",
    "thoughts and and be a little not not",
    "necessarily critical but um be observant",
    "of yourself more objectively and then",
    "you'll kind of realize your own loops",
    "and patterns. It takes time. It's not",
    "it's not overnight. It's not",
    "instantaneous. So you mean letting go is",
    "not a one-time event. Yeah. And and",
    "there's letting go is not necessarily",
    "even the right answer. Like yes, if",
    "you're trying to be an enlightened being",
    "and you know you want to live like a god",
    "and everything's going to be perfect and",
    "be a Buddha, sure you can let go. But uh",
    "I think in practice it's actually quite",
    "hard to do.",
    "Um, I think I would say that it's uh",
    "you're going to find a lot of",
    "fulfillment out of life by just doing",
    "what you want to do and genuinely",
    "exploring what it is that you want",
    "rather than doing what other people",
    "expect you to do or society expects you",
    "to do or what you might just think",
    "should be done by default. Um, you know,",
    "I think most older successful people",
    "will tell you that their life was best",
    "when they lived it unapologetically on",
    "their own terms.",
    "Be selfish. Holistic selfishness. We can",
    "clip that little selfish. Yeah. Yeah.",
    "Yeah. Keep running back. Bad guy. Great.",
    "I I had this insight or a question, I",
    "guess. How much do you think that we",
    "should trust the voice in our heads?",
    "Because half of wisdom suggests to rely",
    "on your sort of bottomup intuition and",
    "then half of it has to be sort of top",
    "down rational as possible. How do you",
    "navigate the tension between head and",
    "gut in this way?",
    "I think the gut is what decides. Um the",
    "head is kind of what rationalizes it",
    "afterwards. The gut is the ultimate",
    "decision maker. If it doesn't and and",
    "what is the gut? The gut is refined",
    "judgment. It's taste aggregate",
    "aggregated and it could be aggregated",
    "through evolution uh and it's in your",
    "genes and your DNA or it could be",
    "aggregated through your experiences and",
    "what you've thought through. The mind is",
    "good at solving new problems and uh new",
    "problems in the external world that have",
    "defi defined edges you know beginnings",
    "and ends and and",
    "objectives. What the mind is actually",
    "really bad at is making hard decisions.",
    "So when you have a hard decision to make",
    "I find it's better to yes you ruminate",
    "on it. You think through all the pros",
    "and cons but then you sleep on it. You",
    "wait a couple of days. You wait until",
    "the gut answer appears with conviction",
    "and it feels right. And when you're",
    "younger, it takes longer because you",
    "just don't have as much experience. And",
    "when you're older, uh, it can happen",
    "much faster, which is why, you know, and",
    "you have less time to Yeah. And old",
    "people just more set in their ways as a",
    "consequence, right? They know what they",
    "want. They know what they don't want.",
    "Um, so it takes time to develop your gut",
    "instinct and judgment. But once you've",
    "developed them, don't trust anything",
    "else because you can't go against your",
    "gut. It'll bite you in the end. Uh",
    "usually in relationships that failed,",
    "you can look back and say, \"Oh,",
    "actually, I knew it was going to fail",
    "because of this reason, but I kind of",
    "went ahead anyway because I wanted it to",
    "be this way, right? I wanted this person",
    "to be a different way than they are, or",
    "I wanted to get a different thing out of",
    "it than I thought I was going to than I",
    "knew I was going to get, but I just",
    "wanted it.\" So sometimes desire will",
    "override your judgment and then trap.",
    "Yeah. Wishful thinking. It traps you",
    "into a into a pathway that chews up",
    "time. What's that uh inside of yours? U",
    "we think we can't change ourselves but",
    "we can. We think we can change other",
    "people but we can't. Exactly. I think to",
    "add to that you can't change other",
    "people. You can change your reaction to",
    "them. You can change yourself but other",
    "people only change through trauma or",
    "their own insight on their own schedule",
    "and never in a way that you like. Yeah.",
    "Alanderon says that uh people do",
    "sometimes change but rarely in",
    "relationships and never when they're",
    "told to. Absolutely. Yeah. The fastest",
    "way to kind of alienate somebody is to",
    "tell them to change. In fact, uh the",
    "Dale Carnegie School of Public Speaking,",
    "you know, the way that operates is, uh",
    "they get you up there and they realize",
    "that the number one problem with public",
    "speaking is uh that uh people are very",
    "self-conscious and so uh people who are",
    "practicing in the Dale Carnegie School",
    "of Public Speaking, I don't know, I",
    "never went through I heard this",
    "secondhand so I could be wrong but I",
    "like the story where they get up and",
    "they start speaking and the people in",
    "the audience are only allowed to",
    "compliment them genuine compliments not",
    "fake compliments on things that they did",
    "well but you're not allowed to criticize",
    "them on things that they did poorly and",
    "eventually they kind of get through it",
    "and they develop the self-confidence the",
    "same way uh there's like the Michelle",
    "Thomas school of language learning and",
    "on that one what they do is you listen",
    "to a teacher talking to a student",
    "they're not teaching you you're not",
    "expected to remember or memorize",
    "anything you just listen to a student",
    "stumbling over the language. It's a",
    "better way to learn because you yourself",
    "don't feel flustered. You're being",
    "tested, graded. Oh, so you're not in",
    "your own head as much. Correct. You're",
    "not in your own head and you're just you",
    "might even be laughing at the student or",
    "you might be agreeing with the teacher",
    "or vice versa or sympathizing with the",
    "student. But because you are a passive",
    "observer, you can be more objective",
    "about it and you aren't threatened or",
    "fearful and you can learn better. And",
    "coming back to the original point of you",
    "can't change people. If you do want to",
    "change someone's behavior, I I think the",
    "only effective way to do it is to",
    "compliment them when they do something",
    "you want. Not to positive. Yeah.",
    "Exactly. Not to insult them or be",
    "negative or critical when they do",
    "something you don't want. And we can't",
    "help it. It's obviously in our nature to",
    "criticize. And I do it as well, but it",
    "just reminds me that like when somebody",
    "does something praiseworthy, don't",
    "forget to praise them. Like definitely",
    "go out of your way and and it'll be",
    "genuine. It has to be genuine. It can't",
    "be a fake thing. uh this is not, you",
    "know, one of those uh just dropping",
    "compliments type thing eventually that",
    "people will see through that. They want",
    "authenticity, but just don't forget to",
    "praise people when they do something",
    "praiseworthy and you'll get more of that",
    "behavior. There was a a really famous",
    "thread on Reddit about five questions to",
    "ask yourself if you're uncertain about",
    "your relationship. One of the questions",
    "was, \"Are you truly in love with your",
    "partner or just their potential or the",
    "idea of them?\" And that's the, you know,",
    "they show such great promise. They they",
    "look at their look at their ability for",
    "for for change and growth. They they",
    "they they're on the right path. The",
    "partner matching thing is so hard. Uh",
    "you know, when people come and ask me",
    "like, \"Oh, should I be with this",
    "person?\" Like, \"Well, if you're asking",
    "me, the answer is clearly no.\" Right?",
    "Because you wouldn't have to ask if you",
    "were with the right person or when you",
    "ask someone like why they're uh in a",
    "relationship with somebody and they",
    "start reading out his or her resume,",
    "right? That's also a bad sign. What do",
    "you mean? Oh, it's like, oh, we have so",
    "much in common. We like to golf",
    "together. It's like, it's not a basis",
    "for a relationship. Or, oh, you know,",
    "she's a ballerina or, you know, he went",
    "to Harvard or what have you. These are",
    "resume items. That's not who the person",
    "actually is. What's a better answer? I",
    "just love being with this person. I just",
    "trust them. I, you know, I I enjoy being",
    "around them. I I I love how capable he",
    "is. I love how kind kind she is. You",
    "know, I love her spirit. I love his",
    "energy.",
    "uh the more the the more materially and",
    "concretely definable the reasons are",
    "you're together the worse they are. Uh",
    "the ineffable is actually where the sort",
    "of true love lies because real love is a",
    "form of unity. It's a form of",
    "connection. It's connecting spirits. Oh",
    "you two, my consciousness meets your",
    "consciousness. It's a the the the",
    "underlying drive uh in love, in art, in",
    "uh science, in uh mysticism is the",
    "desire for unity. It's a desire for",
    "connection. As you know, Bourhees",
    "famously wrote, \"In every human, there's",
    "a sense that something infinite has been",
    "lost.\" You know, there's a God-shaped",
    "hole in you you're trying to fill. And",
    "so, we're always trying to find that",
    "connection. Love is trying to find it in",
    "one other person and saying, \"Okay,",
    "you're male, I'm female, or whatever.\"",
    "And you know, whatever your",
    "predilictions are, and now now we",
    "connect, now we form a hole uh connected",
    "hole. Or in mysticism it's like it's all",
    "about okay sit down meditate and you'll",
    "feel the whole. In science it's like oh",
    "uh you know atoms bouncing is mechanics",
    "but that generates heat. So",
    "thermodynamics and motion or kinetics",
    "are one combined theory that's a whole.",
    "Electricity and magnetism are one thing",
    "that's that's the whole creates that",
    "sense of awe. Uh in art it's like I feel",
    "an emotion I create a piece of art",
    "around it and then you see that painting",
    "or you see the cysteine chapel or you",
    "read the poem and you feel that emotion.",
    "M so again it's it's creating unity it's",
    "creating connection and I think",
    "everybody craves that and so when you",
    "really love somebody it's because you",
    "you feel a sense of wholeness by being",
    "around them. Uh and that sense of",
    "wholeness probably doesn't have anything",
    "to do with what school they went to, you",
    "know, or what career they're in. Just",
    "sort of tying that into the life is",
    "short, stop [ __ ] about. Uh if you're",
    "faced with a difficult choice and you",
    "cannot decide, the answer is no. And the",
    "reason is modern society is full of",
    "options. Yeah. Knowing this rationally",
    "sounds sounds great, but having the",
    "courage to commit to it in reality, I",
    "think is a different task. And cutting",
    "your losses quickly in the big three,",
    "relationships, jobs, and locations is",
    "hard. What would you say to someone who",
    "may cerebrally be able to agree with you",
    "and say, \"I understand.\" My cousin said",
    "this about me. He said that uh he said",
    "what I really he says what I've really",
    "noticed about you is your ability to",
    "walk away from situations that are just",
    "not great enough for you or not good",
    "enough for you. And I think that is a",
    "characteristic that I have. I will not",
    "accept second best outcomes in my life.",
    "Um ultimately you will end up wherever",
    "is acceptable to you. You will get out",
    "of life whatever is acceptable to you.",
    "Um, and there are certain things to me",
    "that are very very important where I",
    "will not settle for second best. But",
    "then there are a lot of other things I",
    "just don't care about because if I spend",
    "all my time caring about those things, I",
    "don't have the energy for the few things",
    "that matter. And uh, so in decision-m I",
    "have a few heristics for myself. Other",
    "people can use their own, but mine are",
    "if you can't decide, the answer is no.",
    "If you're offered an opportunity, if you",
    "have a new thing that you're saying yes",
    "or no to that is a change from where",
    "you're starting, the answer is by",
    "default always no. Secondly, uh if you",
    "have two decisions, if you have A or B",
    "and both seem like very equal, take the",
    "path that's more painful in the short",
    "term, the one that's going to be painful",
    "immediately because your brain is always",
    "trying to avoid pain. So any pain that",
    "is imminent, it is going to treat as",
    "much larger than it actually is. This is",
    "kind of like a decision-making",
    "equivalent of Talib surgeon. Uh tell",
    "surgeon where you want the surgeon that",
    "doesn't look as good because he's more",
    "likely to be a good surgeon. Yeah, it's",
    "similar in that appearances are",
    "deceiving because you're avoiding",
    "conflict. You're avoiding pain. So take",
    "the path is more painful in the short",
    "term because your brain is creating this",
    "illusion that the short-term pain is",
    "greater than the long-term pain. Because",
    "long-term yeah you you'll commit your",
    "future self to all kinds of long-term",
    "mana. Mñana exactly mñana. So take the",
    "more short-term painful one. And then",
    "finally the last one which I would",
    "credit Kapo Gupta with uh is that you",
    "want to take it take the choice that",
    "will leave you more equinimous in the",
    "long term. By quantumous he means like",
    "more at peace more mental peace in the",
    "long term. So whatever clears your mind",
    "more and will have you having less",
    "self-t talk in the future if you can",
    "model that out that is probably the",
    "better route to go. And then I would",
    "focus decision-m down on the three",
    "things that really matter because",
    "everything else is downstream of these",
    "these three decisions. Especially these",
    "are early life decisions. Later in life,",
    "you have different things to optimize",
    "for. But early in life, you're trying to",
    "figure out who you're with, what you're",
    "doing, and where you live. And I think",
    "on all three of those, you want to think",
    "you want to think pretty hard about it.",
    "And people do some of these",
    "unconsciously. You know, who you're with",
    "very often it's like, well, we were in a",
    "relationship. We stumbled along. It felt",
    "okay. It had been enough time, so we got",
    "married. Right? Not great reasons. Maybe",
    "not terrible reasons either. I mean,",
    "people who overthink these things",
    "sometimes don't get the right answer.",
    "But maybe here, if you're the kind of",
    "person that's not going to settle for",
    "second best, you iterate. You iterate on",
    "a closed time frame so you don't run out",
    "the clock. And then you decide um on",
    "what you do. You try a whole bunch of",
    "different things until you find the one",
    "that feels like play to you, looks like",
    "work to others. You can't lose at it. Um",
    "get some leverage. try to find some",
    "practical application of it and go into",
    "that. And then where you live, uh where",
    "you live is really important. I don't",
    "think people spend enough time on that",
    "one. I think people pick cities randomly",
    "based on where I went to school or where",
    "my family happened to be or where uh my",
    "friend was or I visited one weekend. I",
    "really liked it. You really want to",
    "think it through because where you live",
    "really constrains and defines your",
    "opportunities. Um it uh it it's going to",
    "determine your friend circle. It's going",
    "to determine your dating pool. It's",
    "going to determine your job",
    "opportunities. It's going to determine",
    "the food and air and water quality that",
    "you receive. Um, it's going to determine",
    "your proximity to your family, which",
    "might be important as you get older and",
    "have kids. So, very, very, very",
    "important decision. Weather, you know,",
    "quality of life. How much do you stay",
    "inside or outside? How long are you",
    "going to live based on that? And I think",
    "people choose that one probably more",
    "poorly than they put a lot less thought",
    "into that one than the other two. I in",
    "some ways, yeah, but also the You're so",
    "right. How many people fall backward",
    "into a relationship and before they know",
    "it, we're living together, we got a dog,",
    "we got a kid, we were married and you",
    "know, yeah. And then when you have kids,",
    "because then that's half of you and half",
    "of them running around, you're never",
    "going to separate yourself from that. So",
    "once you have a child with somebody,",
    "then the most important thing in the",
    "world to you is half that other person",
    "whether you like them or not. Mhm. Yeah.",
    "Uh Jeffrey Miller had a tweet a long",
    "time ago that I always think about and",
    "he said every parenting book in the",
    "world could be replaced with one book on",
    "behavioral genetics that I am a big",
    "believer in genetics. Yes, I do think a",
    "lot of behavior is downstream of",
    "genetics and I think we underplay that.",
    "We like to overplay nurture and",
    "underplay nurture for sorry underplay",
    "nature for societal reasons but nature",
    "is a big deal. Um the temperament of the",
    "person you marry is probably going to be",
    "reflected in your child by default.",
    "people want securely attached kid, pick",
    "a securely attached partner. Well, the",
    "secret to a happy relationship is two",
    "happy people, right? So, I would say if",
    "you want to be happy, then uh be with a",
    "happy person. Don't think you're going",
    "to be with someone who's unhappy and",
    "then make them happy down the road. Or",
    "if you're okay with them being unhappy,",
    "but there are other things you like",
    "about them, that's fine. But this goes",
    "back to the unhappiness with other",
    "things. Yes. And actually we we talked a",
    "little bit about how people do connect",
    "successfully, you know, on spirit and",
    "and those things, but that's maybe a",
    "little too abstract. If you want to get",
    "a little more practical, it could be",
    "based on values. And values are a set of",
    "things you won't compromise on. Values",
    "are the tough decisions of, oh, my",
    "parent got sick. Do they move in with us",
    "or do we put them in a in a nursing",
    "home? Uh, you know, the ch do we give",
    "the children money or do we not? uh you",
    "know do we um do we move across the",
    "country to be closer to our family or do",
    "we stay put where we are uh you know do",
    "we argue about politics do we care or do",
    "we not right the values are way more",
    "important than checklist items uh and uh",
    "I think if people were to align much",
    "more on their values they would have",
    "much more successful relationships",
    "the emotional pain of of fearing change",
    "I have this thing the job the location",
    "the partner I'm going to enter or not",
    "enter this thing. For the most part,",
    "it's leaving. I think we have this sort",
    "of loss aversion that that we really",
    "feel evolved loss aversion. It's just",
    "painful separating yourself in front of",
    "your friends. It's embarrassing. And how",
    "how would you advise people to uh get",
    "past themselves with the loss aversion?",
    "That fear of change. Oh my god, am I",
    "going to Yeah, it's the hardest thing in",
    "the world. Uh starting over. It's back",
    "to the zero to one thing. It's uh it's",
    "the mountain climbing thing. You're not",
    "going to find your path to the top of",
    "the mountain in the first go around.",
    "Sometimes you go up there, you get",
    "stuck, and you come back down. And the",
    "difference between all the successful",
    "people and the ones who are not is the",
    "ones who are successful want it so badly",
    "they're willing to go back and start",
    "over again and again whether in their",
    "career or in their relationships or in",
    "anything else. The more seriously you",
    "take yourself the unhappier you're going",
    "to be. You learned how to take yourself",
    "less seriously. Well, fame doesn't help",
    "on that one because that is one of the",
    "traps of fame. People are always talking",
    "about you. they have a certain view of",
    "you and you start believing that and",
    "then you take yourself seriously and",
    "then that limits your own actions. You",
    "can't look like a fool anymore. Um you",
    "can't do new things anymore. You know,",
    "tomorrow I announce I'm a break dancer,",
    "right? That's going to be met with a lot",
    "of scorn and ridicule. But what if I",
    "want to be back? I'd back I'd back you",
    "if you want to make that. Yeah. The",
    "truth is if I want to be a break dancer,",
    "I'd be break dancing. But uh you know",
    "like I'm starting a new company 0ero to",
    "one again from scratch. Let's do it you",
    "know one more time. uh and not just",
    "going and raising a big VC fund or",
    "retiring or what have you, but that's",
    "because I want to build the product. I",
    "want to see it exist. So, I think that",
    "you constantly just have to force",
    "yourself. You have to remind yourself.",
    "Um, look, deep down you're still the",
    "same Chris you were when you were 9",
    "years old. Deep down, you're still a",
    "kid. Uh, you know, you're still curious",
    "about the world. You're still have a lot",
    "of the same predilictions and desires",
    "and wants. You've got a nice veneer on",
    "it. But one of the nice things when you",
    "have kids is you realize how much closer",
    "they are to you in personality and",
    "knowledge and knowhow. Like I look at my",
    "son who's uh you know he's eight and uh",
    "I just noticed like wow he's probably",
    "has 60 to 80% of my knowledge and",
    "development wisdom and he has a lot more",
    "freedom and he has a lot more",
    "spontaneity. In some ways he's smarter",
    "and there's not a big gap here left to",
    "close. this kid's going to be, you know,",
    "done very soon. It caught up to me. And",
    "so to the extent that I think I know",
    "better or that I'm somewhere or that I'm",
    "someone, it's it's just an illusion.",
    "It's is it's just a belief. What's the",
    "lineage between that and taking yourself",
    "too seriously?",
    "I shouldn't take myself too seriously",
    "because there's nothing here to take",
    "that seriously. And if I take myself too",
    "seriously, then I'm going to get",
    "trapped. I'm going to get I'm going to",
    "circumscribe myself again into a limited",
    "set of behaviors and outcomes that keep",
    "me from being free, keep me from being",
    "spontaneous, keep me from being happy.",
    "Um,",
    "so it it just goes back to the, you",
    "know, don't think about yourself too",
    "much. There's a special type of pain in",
    "realizing that the advice that you need",
    "to hear right now is something that",
    "almost always you learned a long time",
    "ago and that you know you're basically",
    "sort of the same person you were as you",
    "were nine. You know a lot of the time",
    "people ask questions like um what advice",
    "do you wish that you would give yourself",
    "10 years ago? People ask themselves that",
    "question",
    "almost invariably the advice that you",
    "would give yourself 10 years ago is",
    "still the advice that you need to hear",
    "today. Absolutely. That's why I did that",
    "exercise of thinking back, you know, 10",
    "years, 20 years, 30 years ago. What",
    "advice would I give myself? For me, it's",
    "just be less",
    "emotional. Don't take don't take",
    "everything so seriously. Do the same",
    "things, but do them without all the",
    "emotional turbulence.",
    "And so, that's the advice I'm giving",
    "myself going forward. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",
    "Yeah. It's funny how we need that",
    "distance to be able to be a little bit",
    "more objective, to have a little bit",
    "more perspective. And it's almost a",
    "little bit of a trick, right? Because",
    "typically when you do that you say what",
    "would you tell a friend that was going",
    "through this right and then you try and",
    "turn the advice to the friend around",
    "onto yourself but you always think well",
    "I'm not the friend you go okay you 10",
    "years ago there's enough distance in",
    "that you go oh I actually am still that",
    "person there's just a single line",
    "between that and and related to this",
    "story is I think understanding is way",
    "more important than discipline now Jaco",
    "would have a fit but you know on",
    "physical things discipline is important",
    "if I want To build a good body, I got to",
    "work out on a regular basis. But on",
    "mental things, I think understanding is",
    "way more important. Once you see the",
    "truth of something, you cannot unsee it.",
    "All of us have had experiences where",
    "we've seen a behavior in a person and",
    "then it just changes what we think about",
    "that person. We no longer want to be",
    "friends with them or we deeply respect",
    "them if it was, you know, really good",
    "behavior that maybe was observed",
    "unintentionally.",
    "Um, so when we when we really do see",
    "something clearly, it changes our",
    "behavior immediately and that is far",
    "more efficient than trying to change",
    "your behavior through repetition. Could",
    "you give me an example?",
    "Um, if you were, let's say that, you",
    "know, you have a friend and then that",
    "person turns out to be a thief, you see",
    "that person stealing something, you're",
    "done with them.",
    "uh if you are uh you know the the",
    "smoking lung cancer example is a good",
    "one right someone close to you or",
    "anytime someone close to you dies or you",
    "even hear about someone dying you hear",
    "about someone dying what's the first",
    "thing you do the first thing assuming",
    "that you weren't that close to them",
    "obviously you're close to them it's",
    "different but if you weren't that close",
    "to them but you know you hear about",
    "someone in your extended social dying",
    "you immediately start trying to",
    "different distinguish yourself from them",
    "you're like oh well how old was this",
    "person you know did they have were they",
    "a smoker you know did they have an issue",
    "do I have that issue, right? You",
    "immediately start comparing and what",
    "what you're what you're doing there is",
    "you're sort of just trying to see if",
    "there's an overlap here. But if you see",
    "the truth in something, if if you're",
    "like, \"Oh my god, this person was the",
    "same age as me and they died.\" And",
    "that's starting to happen at my age",
    "where I'm starting to hear about, you",
    "know, extended circle",
    "people just reminds you time is really",
    "short. There's a truth there. There's a",
    "truth there that you cannot action.",
    "There's a truth there that you cannot",
    "unsee. Uh, you know, or for example, I",
    "think were you into bodybuilding or",
    "something back when? I don't know. Like",
    "bro lifting stuff, be less of a skinny",
    "[ __ ] Yeah. Right. But there probably",
    "was a point where you were uh being",
    "really aggro in the gym and you injured",
    "yourself many times, right? And each one",
    "of those was an deep understanding of",
    "don't go beyond this point, right? There",
    "was a truth there. So again, when you",
    "when you see these things in such a way",
    "that you can't unsee them, that changes",
    "your behavior instantly. And I would",
    "argue that that introspection to find",
    "those truths is actually very useful. Is",
    "that a justification for more",
    "experimentation,",
    "exploration, experience in life, sort of",
    "trying to find serendipity because all",
    "of these experiences are going to teach",
    "you a inescapable lesson.",
    "You're going to do what you're going to",
    "do. I mean, your level of exploration, I",
    "think, is sort of up to you. But life is",
    "always throwing truth back at you. Uh,",
    "it's about whether you choose to see it,",
    "whether you choose to acknowledge it.",
    "Uh, even if it's painful. Truth is often",
    "painful, right? If it wasn't, we'd all",
    "be seeing truth all the time. Reality is",
    "always reflecting truth. That's all it",
    "is. Why would you not have accessed it",
    "already? Exactly. Uh, you know, all the",
    "all the philosophy that's out there, for",
    "example, uh, it's almost trit. Like most",
    "people they look at philosophy like",
    "until they discover it for themselves",
    "and because because wisdom is the set of",
    "things that that cannot be transmitted.",
    "If they could be transmitted, you know,",
    "we'd read the same five philosophy books",
    "and we'd all be done. We'd all be wise.",
    "You have to learn it for yourself. It",
    "has to be rediscovered for yourself in",
    "your own context. You have to have",
    "specific experiences that then allow you",
    "to generalize and see the truth in those",
    "things in such a way that you're not",
    "going to unsee them. But each person is",
    "going to see them in a different way. I",
    "can tell you that Socrates story and",
    "it's not going to resonate until there's",
    "something that other people desire that",
    "you realize you yourself don't want. And",
    "the moment that happens, then you'll see",
    "the truth in the general statement. I",
    "want to just read you a twominute essay",
    "that I wrote uh a couple of weeks ago.",
    "So, it's called unteable lessons. Okay.",
    "I've been thinking about a special",
    "category of lesson, one which you cannot",
    "discover without experiencing it",
    "firsthand. There is a certain subset of",
    "advice that for some reason we all",
    "refuse to learn through instruction.",
    "These are unteachable lessons. No matter",
    "how arduous or costly or effortful it is",
    "going to be for us to find out",
    "ourselves, we prefer to disregard the",
    "mountains of warnings from our elders,",
    "songs, literature, historical",
    "catastrophes, public scandals, and",
    "instead think some version of, \"Yeah,",
    "that might be true for them, but not for",
    "me.\" We decide to learn the hard lessons",
    "the hard way over and over again.",
    "Unfortunately, they all seem to be the",
    "big things, too. It's never new insights",
    "about how to put up level shelves or",
    "charmingly introduce yourself at a",
    "cocktail party. Instead, we spend most",
    "of our lives learning firsthand the most",
    "important lessons that the previous",
    "generations already warned us about.",
    "Things like money won't make you happy.",
    "Fame won't fix your self worth. You",
    "don't love that pretty girl. She's just",
    "hot and difficult to get. Nothing is as",
    "important as you think it is when you're",
    "thinking about it. You will regret",
    "working too much. Worrying is not",
    "improving your performance. All your",
    "fears are a waste of time. You should",
    "see your parents more. You'll be fine",
    "after the breakup and will be grateful",
    "that you did it. It's perfectly okay to",
    "cut toxic people out of your life. And",
    "even reading this list back, I'm rolling",
    "my eyes at how [ __ ] trite it is.",
    "These are all basic [ __ ] obvious",
    "insights that everybody has heard",
    "before. But if they're so basic, why",
    "does everyone so reliably fall prey to",
    "them throughout our lives? And if",
    "they're so obvious, why do people who",
    "have recently become famous or wealthy",
    "or lost a parent or gone through a",
    "breakup start to proclaim these facts",
    "with the renewed grandio ceremony of",
    "someone who's just gone through",
    "religious revelation? It's also a very",
    "contentious list of points to say on the",
    "internet. If you interview a billionaire",
    "who says that all of his money didn't",
    "make him happy, or a movie star who said",
    "that her fame felt like a prison, the",
    "internet will tear them apart for being",
    "ungrateful and out of touch. So, not",
    "only do we refuse to learn these",
    "lessons, we even refuse to hear the",
    "message from those warning us about",
    "them. And even more than that, I think",
    "for every one of these, if I consider a",
    "bit deeper, I can recall a time,",
    "including right now, where I convinced",
    "myself that I am the exception to the",
    "rule. That my particular mental makeup",
    "or life situation or historical wounds",
    "or dreams for the future render me",
    "immune to these lessons being",
    "applicable. No, no, no. My inner",
    "landscape would be solved by skirting",
    "around the most well-known wisdom of the",
    "ages. No, no, no. I can thread this",
    "needle properly. Watch me dance through",
    "the minefield and avoid all of the trip",
    "wires that everyone else kicks. And then",
    "you kick one. And you share a knowing",
    "luck, the kind that can only occur",
    "between two people who have been hurt in",
    "the exact same way. And a voice in the",
    "back of your mind will say, \"I told you",
    "so.\" That's unable. It's a good essay. I",
    "I think one of the reasons why these",
    "lessons are unteachable is because uh",
    "they're too broad. They have to be",
    "applied in context. A number of the ones",
    "that you laid out contradict each other.",
    "Like spend more time with your parents",
    "and you know don't work so hard but you",
    "know at the same time you do want to be",
    "successful, right? I think I think a lot",
    "of these lessons come from down on high",
    "from as you said like the famous movie",
    "star or the billionaire saying oh you",
    "don't need to be happy. It's like well",
    "okay then give it up [ __ ] right? Uh",
    "so in reality I think many of these",
    "contradict each other and they it's like",
    "if you went to school and you just",
    "studied philosophy for four years you",
    "would not know how to live life because",
    "you wouldn't know which philosophical",
    "doctrine to apply in which circumstance.",
    "Uh you have to actually live life go",
    "through all of the issues to figure out",
    "what it is that you want. What's the",
    "context in which some of these things",
    "apply and some of them don't. Um, yes,",
    "you want to visit your parents more",
    "often, but you don't want to live with",
    "your parents and you don't want to",
    "necessarily see them every day or every",
    "weekend depending on the parent. You",
    "might not get along with one of them.",
    "So, I think it is highly contextual. Um,",
    "that said, I I I would argue that once",
    "you figure it out for yourself, you can",
    "kind of carve these variations on these",
    "maxims that apply to you and uh then",
    "you'll have a specific experience that",
    "helps you remember it and actually",
    "execute on it. And you can also phrase",
    "it in a way where it's not trit anymore.",
    "So like Yeah. So so a lot of my maxims",
    "and notes to self are carved in a way",
    "that they're modernized. They're saying",
    "something true which might be trit if I",
    "didn't say it in a new way or in an",
    "interesting way that is more relevant to",
    "me today. There was a Nobel Prize winner",
    "who said something to the effect of uh",
    "everything worth saying may have been",
    "said before but given that nobody was",
    "listening it must be said again. Yeah.",
    "It has to be said again has to be",
    "recontextualized for the modern age.",
    "things do change, technology changes,",
    "things culture changes, people change.",
    "on that. I've heard you say uh you talk",
    "about the difference between seeming",
    "wise and being wise that uh you tried to",
    "appear smart as a kid uh by sort of do",
    "wrote memorization masquerading as",
    "insight and wisdom and uh I I certainly",
    "feel that you know a lot of the show for",
    "me I think has been was and still is a",
    "redemption arc from this you know decade",
    "of my life where I completely suppressed",
    "any intellectual curiosity. It's like,",
    "okay, I'll be a professional party boy",
    "for 10 years, stand on the front door of",
    "a nightclub and give out VIP wristbands",
    "and have access to all of the pretty",
    "girls or, you know, the cool parties or",
    "whatever it might be. Seems like it",
    "worked out. Okay, it did in some ways. I",
    "mean, isn't that fun? It's it it was",
    "look, it was a good way to spend my",
    "20ies, but to sort of come back above,",
    "put your head above water, two degrees,",
    "one of which was a masters, and then",
    "this like just shut down any of that",
    "learn I mean, I I did that while I was",
    "at uni. While I was at uni, I was",
    "running the events. So, it's actually a",
    "decade and a half. And uh I think there",
    "was a big redemption arc within this",
    "show. And I I constantly have to kind",
    "of wipe the slime off me of this sense",
    "that I need to prove myself. And so much",
    "of it, this why it really resonates with",
    "me. Um when you're memorizing things",
    "that indicates that you don't understand",
    "them or that sort of yeah, wrote",
    "memorization and regurgitation",
    "masquerading as wisdom. Um because",
    "people use fluency as a proxy for",
    "truthfulness and insight. They use the",
    "complexity of your language and your",
    "communication. Yeah. There's a lot of",
    "jargon out there. I think it's it's it's",
    "the mark of a charlatan to explain a",
    "simple thing in a complex way. And so",
    "when you see people using very",
    "complicated language to explain simple",
    "things, they're either trying to impress",
    "you and offiscate or they don't",
    "understand it themselves. Well, there's",
    "an allure in that though. You know, this",
    "was one of the things I had to do when I",
    "went to therapy. It's kind of an",
    "interesting I think I've talked about",
    "this before. Um, I needed to turn off",
    "podcast Chris when I stepped into",
    "therapy because most of the time that I",
    "spend one-on-one in a deep conversation",
    "that's undistracted throughout the week.",
    "I trained myself over, you know, when I",
    "started doing it 700 episodes now, 900,",
    "whatever. Uh, and I I knew what I could",
    "do to say to this therapist some, you",
    "know, to just sort of veer off a little",
    "and create some nice story, put a bow on",
    "it, push it across the table, and watch",
    "your eyes light up a little bit, like a",
    "little grin or a self-deprecating joke",
    "or whatever. I'm like, you're not here.",
    "You're you're performing. You're doing",
    "this. You're doing the Chris Williamson",
    "thing with the sort of jazz hands. So, I",
    "have my own version. Okay, tell me.",
    "Okay, so you have podcast Chris. I have",
    "podcast guest Naval. Precisely. So very",
    "often I'll uh think of something. I'll",
    "have some what I think is an insight and",
    "I want to tweet it or write it down, but",
    "in my mind I'm talking about on a",
    "podcast. That's kind of how my mind",
    "registers it. And for a while I thought",
    "this was a bad thing and I tried to",
    "eradicate podcastal and then I just",
    "realized that's just how it comes out.",
    "So I might as well just be okay with it.",
    "Now do you know the reason I'm on this",
    "podcast? No. You know, I haven't done a",
    "proper formal interview straight up top",
    "whatever 10 20 podcasts in a long time.",
    "Since Rogan, maybe. Probably since",
    "Rogan. Yep. Yeah, it went out at the",
    "top, right? That was the theory. Yeah.",
    "Well, it's still at the top. Yeah. Yeah,",
    "I know. And and then, you know, I've",
    "done some stuff with Tim Tim Ferrris, a",
    "good friend, but that's been more",
    "co-hosting. I haven't been a guest. Um,",
    "and then I did one or two random things",
    "where I just stumbled into a thing where",
    "I, you know, there was a reason, but it",
    "wasn't like this. And I reached out to",
    "you for this one, right? I have lots of",
    "people reaching out to me for podcasts.",
    "I do not answer them. I reached out to",
    "you. And the reason is a really funny",
    "one. It's because when I am playing",
    "podcast in the vault in my head, for",
    "some reason, you're on the other side.",
    "And I don't know why. I literally don't",
    "know why. It's not like I've even seen",
    "many of your podcasts. I think I've seen",
    "some snippets here and there, but for",
    "some reason, you were the guy in the",
    "podcast in podcast. And so, I was like,",
    "I might as well just do it. So, I",
    "reached out to you. I wonder if this",
    "will close that loop or further entrench",
    "it. I wonder if you've made it way worse",
    "now and you're just gonna have Well,",
    "first off, it was a dream and now it's",
    "reality plus a dream and I can't get",
    "away from him. Yeah, there are enough",
    "people that I turned down where I said",
    "I'm just not doing podcasts. I feel bad",
    "about that. I got to go back and do",
    "those podcasts. But I probably wear out",
    "my luck. I have nothing new to talk",
    "about. So, I don't know what I'm going",
    "to say. Well, I appreciate you. You said",
    "on Rogan and this was something, you",
    "know, to kind of pay it back to you. Uh,",
    "I had a a fiveheaded Mount Rushmore of",
    "guests before I started this show and it",
    "was Jordan Peterson, Sam Harris,",
    "Alanderon from the School of Life, you",
    "and Rogan, and that was my uh hydra of",
    "Mount Rushmore. And uh I knew I think",
    "someone had asked you at some point,",
    "maybe it was a tweet or something after",
    "Rogan or maybe even said it on Rogan",
    "where you said, uh, I don't like to say",
    "the same thing twice, at least not in",
    "the same way. I don't like sequels.",
    "Yeah. Yeah. And I really really",
    "respected that. You know, that was 2019.",
    "You said it was uh eight or nine years",
    "ago. It wasn't as long ago as you. I",
    "have a terrible memory. Yeah. Yeah. Um",
    "you're right. 2019 right before co Yes.",
    "And uh I really appreciated that because",
    "there is",
    "something the content game you can",
    "continue to sort of I'm sure I'll have",
    "said many things today that the the",
    "audience will have already heard but",
    "uh caring enough about having novel",
    "insights or at least having a new",
    "perspective on similar insights to say",
    "oh well you know in the space of six",
    "years since you were on Joe a lot of",
    "these well I'm coming at them actually",
    "the first thing I said to you today like",
    "I'm not convinced that I actually fully",
    "agree with that thing that I used to",
    "say, which is cool, right? That's you",
    "showing that the um position that you",
    "put in the ground previously is not a",
    "tether. It's not you being held to it",
    "anymore. Well, I I think the reason why",
    "I wanted to be on this is",
    "because for some reason I have the",
    "impression that you engage in",
    "conversations and I like conversations.",
    "I don't like interviews. Mhm. This is",
    "why I was doing my last startup air",
    "chat, which was all about conversations.",
    "And conversations to me are more",
    "genuine. They're more authentic. There's",
    "a give and take. There's a back and",
    "forth. There's a genuine curiosity. It's",
    "not to say the other podcasters don't do",
    "it. They absolutely do do it. But for",
    "some reason in my mind, I had you as a",
    "guy that I would actually have a",
    "conversation with. And sure enough, you",
    "just read me your essay, which I don't",
    "think anybody else would really do,",
    "right? That implies there's a give and",
    "take. There's a genuine curiosity. And I",
    "think that's useful because then uh",
    "certain inexplicit knowledge that I had",
    "will be surfaced for myself. And I think",
    "that's helpful. Well, you're seeing, you",
    "know, to kind of break the fourth wall a",
    "bit, you're seeing very much of uh some",
    "of the gateway drug insights that you",
    "had that you just don't get to choose.",
    "I'm aware that you kind of have an",
    "anti-guru sentiment in you, like a very",
    "strong like don't listen to me. I don't",
    "know what I'm doing. Is a trap. No, guru",
    "is a trap. do not follow me, do not bow",
    "to me, do not do any of the other things",
    "to me. But, uh, if you see resonance in",
    "another person, and I think this is what",
    "we're all trying to find. You know,",
    "people can complain about the mountains",
    "of content creation that happens and and",
    "maybe rightly so. Um, but if you're able",
    "to find someone and you see in them a",
    "little bit of you, maybe not even much",
    "of you, but like, oh, that bit of them,",
    "their self-esteem or the way they look",
    "at relationships or what they want to",
    "do, the kind of life they want or the",
    "level of peace of mind that they want to",
    "have or whatever it might be. If you",
    "find in somebody else a little bit of",
    "that, it's kind of like what you're",
    "saying before, you can't you can no",
    "longer be unconvinced of that and it it",
    "steps in and becomes a part of you. And",
    "uh yeah, you're maybe seeing reflected",
    "back to you some you know this sort of",
    "percolated very meandering insight from",
    "however long ago that something's",
    "happened and maybe in you know 5 years",
    "time you'll be like you know that thing",
    "that you said about the lessons and then",
    "I don't know it's cool that's like",
    "synthesis right it's this sort of",
    "blending of the reason I spend a lot of",
    "time in San Francisco is because it's a",
    "gravitational attractor for the smartest",
    "people in the world and despite all the",
    "many problems the city had is mismanaged",
    "beyond belief. Um it does just seem to",
    "pull in the young smart creative people.",
    "Uh not just the ones who are building",
    "technology, but they're exploring every",
    "facet of life and they're weird and",
    "sometimes it's repulsive and it's",
    "bizarre, but you talk to these people",
    "and you just see a very intelligent",
    "person coming at life in a completely",
    "different way. um putting it through the",
    "cominatorics of human DNA which are",
    "uncountable and giving you a weird",
    "perspective that can twist your mind",
    "around. And to do that, you always have",
    "to be learning. You you have you can't",
    "be in a guru mentality. If I'm with",
    "somebody and they're listening to every",
    "word I say and hanging on it, that's not",
    "interesting for me. I'm not going to",
    "learn anything. Um, I want people who",
    "are intelligent, who will say something",
    "back that is a little different and I",
    "may not agree with it, but it's going to",
    "leave a mark. It's going to leave an",
    "impression and it's going to leave an",
    "impression to the extent that both that",
    "they are correct and that I choose to",
    "listen and I'll choose to listen if I",
    "don't view myself as higher status or",
    "smarter than them. The flip side of that",
    "is I'm not really impressed by high",
    "status people like I don't just because",
    "the case pretty much in fact uh most of",
    "my friends who have gone on to become",
    "very uh famous successful the more",
    "famous successful they've been the less",
    "I spend time with them um partially",
    "because they get surrounded by an army",
    "of sickop fans which gets hard to break",
    "through uh and because I don't want",
    "anything from them and I don't and I",
    "don't like that I don't like these",
    "situations in which transactional",
    "relationships are implied that can be a",
    "though to people who are up that because",
    "the higher that they climb up that",
    "hierarchy, the fewer and fewer people",
    "don't want anything from them. So in",
    "that way you have an even better friend,",
    "right? But they get they get surrounded",
    "by people who do want things from them",
    "and are so good at pretending they don't",
    "that it's just not worth my time to try",
    "and break out from that group. Um so it",
    "does get lonely at the top so to speak.",
    "But it's also by choice because you know",
    "it's you can problem. Yeah, you can be",
    "your own best friend too. I am my own",
    "best friend actually. So, I really do",
    "enjoy spending time with myself. Yeah.",
    "The smartest people aren't interested in",
    "appearing smart and don't care what you",
    "think is. Yeah. I mean, a a lot of life",
    "is not giving a [ __ ] You know, a lot of",
    "the best things in life come out of",
    "that. Does this",
    "mean sort of talking about that wrote",
    "memorization masquerading as wisdom and",
    "insight thing which I",
    "think perhaps almost certainly uh",
    "podcasts like this will have contributed",
    "to. you know, you hear a an Alanderoton",
    "who's, you know, like a painter with",
    "words. Uh, very simple, very sort of",
    "unpretentious, but if you're",
    "intellectually curious, you see, you",
    "only see the production of his thoughts.",
    "You don't necessarily see the work",
    "that's gone into the thoughts behind.",
    "So, you confuse the presentation of them",
    "for the insight. Does that make sense?",
    "Of course. Yeah. A lot of my stuff is",
    "more polished. Like one of the funny",
    "things, yeah, one of the funny things",
    "that uh right before this uh podcast was",
    "I thought maybe I should go back and",
    "read my old tweets to sort of remember",
    "what I said and I can articulate it",
    "well. But then I realized that's just",
    "performance. I would just be memorizing",
    "my whole stuff to perform. I Well,",
    "that's an extra special level of hell",
    "that you've descended into. I wrote",
    "memorizing me to be more mely. Bingo.",
    "And and to live up to some expectation",
    "or some uh famous personality that I now",
    "have to become some straight jacket that",
    "I have to put on. I'm having to live up",
    "to in private the things that I prefer.",
    "That's right. So, of course, pretty",
    "quickly I saw through that, you know,",
    "it's nonsense and it also constrains my",
    "time and it's just work and it I think",
    "that's that's you know your meditation",
    "practice at work there, that mindfulness",
    "gap to be like, huh? Yeah, there's that",
    "thing again in Exactly. Exactly. So,",
    "it's not about changing your thoughts.",
    "It's not about fixing your thoughts.",
    "It's not about changing yourself. It's",
    "just about being observant of yourself",
    "so that you can then it'll automatically",
    "change. Whatever change needs to happen",
    "will happen. you trying to change",
    "yourself is very circular. Um the mind",
    "trying to change the mind, the mind",
    "doesn't like wrestling with itself. I",
    "don't I don't think it gets you",
    "anywhere. You've spent a lot of time",
    "either creating wealth or thinking about",
    "how to create wealth. What have you",
    "learned are the best places to spend",
    "wealth? To spend wealth. Yeah. Yeah. How",
    "you you spend this time creating this",
    "wealth",
    "accumulating? How does what are the best",
    "ways for you to put it back out? I",
    "actually think Elon had this one figured",
    "out, which is he plowed his own money",
    "back into his own businesses to go and",
    "do bigger and better things for",
    "humanity. Um, so what I would like to,",
    "you know, you could give it to",
    "nonprofits, but a lot of nonprofits are",
    "grifty or it's people who didn't earn it",
    "trying to spend it or they don't have",
    "tight feedback loops on having a good",
    "effect. So, one of the things I want to",
    "do as an aside is I want to create a",
    "little school for young physicists. But",
    "that's that's my nonprofit. A young",
    "physicist. Yeah, that that that's my",
    "nonprofit thing. But uh and I've been",
    "and I've actually uh underwritten",
    "uh media and some physics stuff. I don't",
    "like to talk about it. So I don't I",
    "don't talk about my whatever so-called",
    "philanthropy because I think that makes",
    "it less real. That makes it more status",
    "oriented. Makes it less philanthropic.",
    "Yeah. Exactly. And then people look at",
    "how charitable my charity is. And then",
    "people also come hunting for money. So",
    "there's all that disease. I don't",
    "believe in giving to schools. They have",
    "enough money. Ivy Leagues have enough",
    "money and they don't know how to spend",
    "it. So I think the best use of money is",
    "I think a good business creates a",
    "product for people that they voluntarily",
    "buy and they get value out of. So in",
    "that sense I think Steve Jobs and Elon",
    "and and uh entrepreneurs like that have",
    "created a lot of value for the world. So",
    "one of the things I can do is I can take",
    "my own money and I can invest it in",
    "myself to go and build the next great",
    "thing that I think needs to exist. And",
    "that's basically what I'm doing right",
    "now. I'm doing a new business. I'm",
    "self-unding it. Um, I'm plying a lot of",
    "money into it. I'm going to build",
    "something that I think is beautiful,",
    "that I want to see exist. Um, I really",
    "want to see exist. Have you spoken about",
    "this yet or is it still dark mode? It's",
    "so early. It's Yeah, maybe I'll show it",
    "to you in a few months. Uh, hopefully 6",
    "months. Um, and uh, I'm excited about it",
    "and that's a good use of money. What",
    "about the worst places to spend wealth?",
    "What is the old line? If it flies,",
    "floats or fornicates. Well, very nice",
    "way to change the final F. Very",
    "impressive. That's the way I heard it.",
    "Can't take credit for that. I'm pretty",
    "sure it's Fox, but yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I",
    "think that was u Maybe it was uh Felix",
    "Dennis. Okay. Who who had that quote.",
    "Yeah. He said, \"If a flies floats or",
    "fornicates rented I I think the last one",
    "was a little too",
    "it's wrong that he he didn't have a",
    "family, didn't have kids.\" So, you know,",
    "he missed the big one. Um but yeah,",
    "there there are lots of bad ways to",
    "spend money. Uh I I I believe in",
    "investment, you know, I don't believe in",
    "consumption. Uh yes, you can you're born",
    "with a short housing position. You close",
    "that out, you get yourself a nice house.",
    "Um get yourself some help to free up",
    "your time so you're not doing uh things",
    "that other people can do better. Um",
    "treat people well. You know, always",
    "overpay and expect the best. Uh pay them",
    "like they're the best and expect the",
    "best. Um, but overall I think a good use",
    "of money is to take risks and build",
    "things and do things that other people",
    "can't do. Align it with your own unique",
    "talents so you can keep delivering to",
    "the world. I'm not going to sit idle.",
    "Uh, I'm not going to retire. That's a",
    "that's a waste of whatever time I have",
    "left on this earth. Um, and if I'm doing",
    "something I enjoy, then I'm already in",
    "perpetual retirement. Um, because work",
    "is just a set of things you want to do",
    "that that that you have to do that you",
    "don't want to do. So if you want to do",
    "it, it's not work. Um, and so there are",
    "things that I want to do don't feel like",
    "work. I can put money behind them and I",
    "can use that to make instantiate them",
    "into reality. And I don't want to say",
    "make the world a better place cuz that's",
    "too trit, but it's more just create a",
    "product that I'm proud of that wouldn't",
    "exist otherwise that other people will",
    "get tremendous value. And it's been",
    "enabled through wealth because you're",
    "able to take a level of risk that you",
    "wouldn't have been able to otherwise.",
    "Exactly. Yeah. Wealth gives you freedom.",
    "It gives you freedom to explore more",
    "options. And in my case, it gives me",
    "freedom to start businesses without",
    "having to ask other people for",
    "permission or to warp my vision based on",
    "uh their desires to make a return or how",
    "they think money should be made. Is",
    "there anything that you'd add to the how",
    "to get rich thread? Is there anything",
    "where you thought [ __ ] like just one if",
    "I could go in and edit and add one more",
    "in or or No, there's like 10,000 things.",
    "I could talk about that topic forever to",
    "be honest. like that that that thread",
    "was so short and it was so limited and",
    "it was so like you know crafted in a",
    "sense although I wrote it very",
    "spontaneously um it left so much on the",
    "cutting room floor that I could just",
    "talk about that topic for days but it's",
    "all contextual right business is very",
    "very very contextual like you have to",
    "look at the particular business and",
    "understand what's being done and why",
    "it's being done and how it's being done",
    "and then you can tear it apart or you",
    "can re and then reassemble it properly",
    "um and I like to think that That is",
    "actually where I have specific knowledge",
    "and expertise. My specific knowledge,",
    "expertise is not in happiness, not in",
    "philosophy, not Yes, my life is very",
    "hacked to be very unique. But I don't",
    "think that's where my specific knowledge",
    "is. My specific knowledge is in being",
    "able to analyze a business, especially a",
    "technology business, and take it apart",
    "at the seams and predict in advance what",
    "is likely to work and what is not likely",
    "to work. clubhouse",
    "notwithstanding. Um because you're still",
    "going to be wrong most of the time. It's",
    "like playing the lottery, but you know",
    "one or two of the tickets numbers in",
    "advance. You only have to be right a few",
    "times or even just once to to get the",
    "big score. Um you know, Peter Thiel",
    "started PayPal, but he made all his",
    "money on Facebook, right? And now he's",
    "done more since then, obviously. But",
    "that was the big winner. And that's true",
    "in any power law distribution. Number",
    "one is going to return more than two",
    "through n put together. Two will return",
    "more than three through put together.",
    "you're operating in a highly leveraged",
    "intellectual domain. So the outcomes are",
    "going to be nonlinear. Um so I I know a",
    "lot about that topic, but it's highly",
    "contextual. It makes a lot more sense if",
    "there's a specific business in front of",
    "me, a specific entrepreneur, and I can",
    "take that apart and I can say, you know,",
    "so there are certain companies where",
    "I'll say, \"Oh, this is not going to work",
    "because you, the entrepreneur, are doing",
    "this for the wrong reasons. You're",
    "you're doing A so you can get to B. Just",
    "go to B.\" Or, \"You're doing this to make",
    "money.\" when really the person who's",
    "doing this because they love the product",
    "is going to beat you or you're raising",
    "money from the wrong people who are in",
    "it for the wrong reasons or your",
    "co-founder is not in it for the right",
    "reasons or you don't have the right kind",
    "of co-founder or your vesting schedule",
    "is wrong or you're starting the business",
    "in the wrong place or you're approaching",
    "it from this angle instead of that angle",
    "and and of course I'll be wrong too but",
    "I've just seen a lot of data I have my",
    "theories around it uh and that's where I",
    "feel very comfortable operating the",
    "problem is when I have to talk about how",
    "to create wealth and how to get rich is",
    "a clickbait title deliberately. But when",
    "I talk about how to create wealth,",
    "talking about it in the abstract is very",
    "difficult because then you just want to",
    "speak truth. You have to just say the",
    "timeless stuff. You have to be right in",
    "almost every context and so it really",
    "limits what you can say. The lack of",
    "specificity makes it Yeah. Correct. It's",
    "back to philosophy. But when I if I can",
    "get specific about it, you know, that's",
    "when that's when the real knowledge",
    "could be like a counselor for people.",
    "Yeah. part of the reason why I started",
    "doing podcasts and you know this is ego",
    "at play so I'll admit it freely when I",
    "was tweeting you know I kind of",
    "pioneered philosophy Twitter if you will",
    "or a certain kind of practical",
    "philosophy Twitter where in 140",
    "characters I would try to say something",
    "true in an interesting way that was",
    "insightful to me at the time but then",
    "that got copied there's thousands of us",
    "now right thousands of people spitting",
    "it out chat GPT trying to create these",
    "things all day long um although I like",
    "to say I like to think that my stuff is",
    "incompressible I'm saying it in the",
    "tightest way possible. Um, which is kind",
    "of a little failed poetry background.",
    "Um, but what I realized was if you truly",
    "have a deep understanding of something,",
    "then you can talk about it all day long.",
    "Then you can rederive everything you",
    "need from that understanding. No",
    "memorization required. You can get to it",
    "from first principles and every piece of",
    "what you know is is like a it's like a",
    "Lego block that just fits in and forms a",
    "steel frame. It's solid. It's locked in",
    "there. And so on a podcast, I can unload",
    "much more deeply about some of these",
    "topics. Um, so for example, we can talk",
    "about any business you like, but it has",
    "to be in context. It has to be real. It",
    "has to be an actual problem. Then we can",
    "solve it. I I just really love that",
    "heristic of if you're having to memorize",
    "something, it's because you don't",
    "understand it. You don't understand it.",
    "That's right. If you if you if you have",
    "to memorize something, it's because you",
    "don't understand it. And if you",
    "understand something, you don't have to",
    "memorize it.",
    "Yeah. I again, you know, just to sort of",
    "call",
    "out a lot of what I tried to do this",
    "redemption arc thing of if I sound",
    "smart, that's like being smart, right?",
    "You go, well, chat GPT has memorized the",
    "entire internet. Good luck competing",
    "with that. You're not going to beat it",
    "in memorization. You're not even going",
    "to beat a library at memorization.",
    "You're not going to beat any 10 books in",
    "memorization. So memorization is not the",
    "thing. Understand the value of",
    "memorization is going down by the day.",
    "It's already so low. Understanding is a",
    "thing. Being able to being able Judgment",
    "is the thing. Taste is a thing. Um, and",
    "understanding, judgment, taste, these",
    "come out of having real problems and",
    "then solving them and then finding the",
    "commonalities. What is philosophy?",
    "Everyone, you live long enough, you'll",
    "be a philosopher. Philosophy is just",
    "when you find the hidden generalizable",
    "truths among the specific experiences",
    "that you've had in life and then you",
    "know how to navigate future specific",
    "experiences based on some heristics and",
    "you create a philosophy around that. Any",
    "subject pursued deeply enough will",
    "eventually lead to philosophy. Mastery",
    "in anything, literally anything, will",
    "lead you to being a philosopher. You",
    "just have to stick with it long enough",
    "and generalize the truths back out. And",
    "these are universal truths. It's back to",
    "the unity and variety. You can find you",
    "can find unity in anything if you go",
    "deep enough. And that's why the trit",
    "stuff unfortunately sort of keeps coming",
    "back around. You're like, well, look,",
    "this is cliche for kind of a reason.",
    "It's cliche for reasons. Uh, but you",
    "know, sometimes you learn new things.",
    "Sometimes you do figure out new things",
    "too. Uh even even in philosophy for",
    "example science has advanced as science",
    "has advanced it's actually expanded our",
    "boundaries of philosophy. Um when we",
    "used to think that uh you know the earth",
    "was the center of the universe you would",
    "actually have a different philosophical",
    "outlook than when you think the universe",
    "is vast and we're infantestimally small.",
    "It will give you a different",
    "philosophical outlook. uh the same way",
    "if you think that uh the nature is",
    "driven by angels and demons and gods",
    "versus if there are laws of physics that",
    "are computable and understandable that",
    "will lead you to a different",
    "philosophical outlook. Uh if you think",
    "that knowledge is something that is",
    "passed down from above and through",
    "generations versus something that is",
    "created on the fly and then tested",
    "against reality that will lead you to a",
    "different philosophical outlook. If you",
    "think humans are created by God as",
    "opposed to humans evolved from some, you",
    "know, unicellular organism, yeah, it",
    "still doesn't solve the original",
    "problem. Who created that? But at least",
    "it takes you further down the down the",
    "road. Even sim theory is an attempt at",
    "reformulating philosophy based on what",
    "we know about computers, even though it",
    "kind of leads to a lot of the same",
    "conclusions as you know, creator. But it",
    "it it is at least philosophy that is",
    "informed by technology and by science.",
    "So philosophy can also invol evolve",
    "moral philosophy evolves right uh there",
    "was a time when every culture",
    "practically that was a conquering",
    "culture practice slavery now almost all",
    "cultures abort slavery that's moral",
    "philosophy having evolved um you know",
    "there was even like this sounds too",
    "ludicrous to be true and I don't know if",
    "it fully is true but there were a a",
    "fairly large group of doctors based on",
    "studies who believed until the 1980s",
    "that babies couldn't feel pain and so",
    "even to this day I think circumcision is",
    "done without anesthesia and because",
    "under the theory that you know very",
    "young children babies don't feel pain",
    "and that's ludicrous and there was a",
    "study that came out in the 80s that said",
    "no no no they do feel pain it's like oh",
    "yeah of course right so people can be",
    "stuck in bad philosophical traps for a",
    "long period of time so even philosophy",
    "can make progress and uh as an example",
    "one of the realizations that I had and",
    "this is thanks to uh David Deutsch and",
    "my friend James Pierce and also thinking",
    "it through a little bit is that there",
    "are these timeless old questions that we",
    "run into where the answers seem like",
    "paradoxes. So we stop thinking about",
    "them. So an example is free will. Do you",
    "have free will? Or does anything matter?",
    "Is there a meaning to life?",
    "And there and and we get stuck in them",
    "because for example, is there a meaning",
    "to life? Like yes, life has a meaning",
    "because you're you're right here. You",
    "create your own meaning. This this",
    "moment has all the meaning you could",
    "imagine. It's all the meaning there is.",
    "On the other hand, you're going to die.",
    "It all goes to zero. Heat, death. The",
    "universe has no meaning. Right? So which",
    "one is it? Well, the reason why it seems",
    "paradoxical is because you're asking the",
    "question of a human here and now at a",
    "certain scale and a certain time and",
    "then you're answering it from the",
    "viewpoint of the universe over infinite",
    "time. So, you pull the trick. You switch",
    "the level at which you're answering the",
    "question. And questions should be",
    "answered at the level at which they're",
    "asked. So, if you ask the question, is",
    "there meaning? You, Chris, are asking",
    "that question. Yes. Yes. To Chris, there",
    "is meaning. There's meaning right here.",
    "This is the meaning. you can interpret",
    "any meaning you want onto it. Um, don't",
    "ask the question as Chris and then",
    "answer it as God or as the universe.",
    "That's the trick that you're playing.",
    "That's why it seems paradoxical. The",
    "same way you can say, do I have free",
    "will? People debate free will all day",
    "long. This the question is answered at",
    "the wrong frame. So they ask the",
    "question is do I as an individual have",
    "free will? Hell yeah, I have free will.",
    "My mind body system can't predict what",
    "I'm going to do next. The universe is",
    "infinitely complex. I'm making a choice",
    "in my mind and I'm doing something.",
    "There's my free will. So answer at the",
    "level at which you were asked. Of course",
    "I have free will because I feel like I",
    "have free will and I treat you like you",
    "have free will and you treat me like I",
    "have free will. We have free will. The",
    "problem then is you start trying to",
    "answer the question as if you're the",
    "universe. You're like well on the",
    "universal scale big bang particle",
    "collisions. No one makes any choices.",
    "You know how could you be any different",
    "than the what the universe wants you to",
    "be and it's all one block universe. So",
    "you don't have free will. Don't answer",
    "the question at the level at which it",
    "wasn't asked. So if God asked the",
    "question is there free will? No there is",
    "no free will. the universe asks a",
    "question, there is no free will. But if",
    "an individual asks a question right now,",
    "then yes, there is free will. So a lot",
    "of these paradoxes resolve themselves,",
    "philosophical paradoxes that people have",
    "been struggling with since the beginning",
    "of time when you just realize there",
    "you're you're answering them at a scale",
    "and time different than they were asked.",
    "Speaking of updating beliefs, is there",
    "anything that you've changed your mind",
    "around recently?",
    "Very recently. I mean, all the time. Uh,",
    "but are you talking about like",
    "philosophical existential things or like",
    "technological things? Yeah,",
    "philosophical existential things or",
    "anything that comes to mind. If there's",
    "anything that's front of mind where you",
    "go, ah, yeah, that's a pretty big OS",
    "update. Yeah, I'm less lazy fair than I",
    "used to be on a societal level. I think",
    "that culture and religion are good",
    "cooperating systems for humans. And so",
    "if you want to operate in a high trust",
    "society, you need to have sets of rules",
    "that people need to follow and obey so",
    "they get along even if they're, you",
    "know, one sizefits-all doesn't work for",
    "everybody. Moved up a little bit from",
    "libertarian. Yeah. I think pure",
    "libertarians get out competed and die,",
    "right? They get overrun because they're",
    "every man for himself. They can't",
    "coordinate. They can't coordinate.",
    "Exactly. Right. Um so the coordination",
    "problems, right? Culture exists to solve",
    "fundamental coordination problems.",
    "Religion solves coordination problems.",
    "Ethnicity solves coordination problems",
    "historically. Um and when you uh break",
    "down those coordination systems too fast",
    "and don't replace them with anything",
    "else, you get societal breakdown. So you",
    "can have very malfunctioning societies.",
    "you know, go to Japan versus go to any",
    "western city and you can see the",
    "difference being a a culture that's",
    "working and a culture that's not. Um, so",
    "I I think that that's like a a broader",
    "set of things that I've changed my mind",
    "on uh a fair bit. I used to be much more",
    "lazy fair on that stuff. Let's put it",
    "that way. Mh. Um, what else? I mean, on",
    "child raising, I've gotten a lot looser.",
    "You know, I'm still not like completely",
    "less afair, but I'm much more realized",
    "like kids are going to be kids and you",
    "kind of let them do their thing. The",
    "debate with them. Is it a Talib that has",
    "the ascending levels of like anarchism",
    "versus conservatism? Is that his",
    "insight? Like at the local level, I'm",
    "this. It seems like you've gone the",
    "other way. It's like at the child level",
    "I'm an anarchist and the societal level",
    "I'm a conservative. No, he he was",
    "quoting somebody else, some brothers, I",
    "forget which ones, but he was making the",
    "point eloquently as he often does uh",
    "that uh at you know at at the family",
    "local level he's a communist. At the",
    "family level you're communist. uh at",
    "maybe the the extended family level",
    "you're a socialist. At the local level,",
    "you know, you're kind of a uh a democrat",
    "and so on until at the federal level",
    "you're a libertarian, right? So, you've",
    "done it the other way. You're being a",
    "libertarian with the kids and you're",
    "being a religious conservative and",
    "societal. No, that's that's that's a",
    "that's a funny way of looking at it. I I",
    "don't know if the scale is that that",
    "simple. Um what else have I changed my",
    "mind on? I mean, I think a modern AI is",
    "really cool. I think it's but I think",
    "these are natural language computers. Um",
    "they're starting to show evidence of",
    "kind of uh reasoning at some levels but",
    "I don't think they do creativity. I",
    "think modern",
    "AI one of so just on that one of my",
    "favorite takes is from Dwash Patel and",
    "he says um",
    "uh if you gave any human on the planet",
    "0.0 0 0 0.1% of the consumption that a",
    "LLM has. Any LLM, they would have come",
    "up with thousands of new ideas, right?",
    "Give me one new idea, one fundamental",
    "new idea that's been generated. Yeah.",
    "Like I'm big into poetry. Every poem",
    "ever written by an LLM is garbage. I",
    "think even their fiction writing is",
    "terrible. Even the new GPT45, with all",
    "due respect to Sam and Crew, uh I I",
    "think they're terrible, terrible",
    "writers. I find them really bad at",
    "summarizing. They're really good at",
    "extrapolating, you know, paperwork. um",
    "they're very bad at actually distilling",
    "the essence of something and what's",
    "important. They don't have an opinions",
    "or a point of view. But they're still",
    "unbelievably powerful breakthroughs.",
    "They solve search. They solve natural",
    "language computing. They make English a",
    "programming language. They solve",
    "driving. They solve uh simple coding and",
    "backup coding. They solve translation.",
    "They solve transcription. Um they are a",
    "fundamental breakthrough in computing.",
    "It is a different way to program a",
    "computer. rather than you explicitly",
    "speak its language and write the code",
    "and then run the data through it. You",
    "just run enough data through it until it",
    "figures out how to write the program.",
    "That's huge. Um but are they are they",
    "AGI? Not yet. And I don't see a direct",
    "path from here to there. Um maybe we'll",
    "have to solve a few more problems before",
    "that happens. And I think ASI is a",
    "fantasy. I don't think there's any such",
    "thing as uh artificial super",
    "intelligence where it has some kind of",
    "intelligence that humans can't fathom.",
    "Okay. Uh yeah, it seems like I don't",
    "know if you're from the boss room camp",
    "or whatever in No, I'm not an AI doomer.",
    "I think that's such a flawed line of",
    "reasoning. But let's say that you know",
    "you came out of the less wrong.com like",
    "slate style codec world and there was",
    "this sort of lineage from computers and",
    "AI gets more powerful more powerful more",
    "powerful and then you end up AGI ASIS",
    "and it seems like LLMs have been this",
    "sort of orthogonal move from that which",
    "are you saying you don't believe they",
    "are a step on that it's kind of a little",
    "bit of a traditional branch I think",
    "Steven Wolf puts it better it's a",
    "different form of intelligence it's like",
    "if you see Jaguar in the jungle, it has",
    "a different form of intelligence in your",
    "like a plant has a form of intelligence",
    "how it can like photosynthesize and",
    "grow. It's a different form of",
    "intelligence. It's not and intelligence",
    "again like love or like happiness is",
    "this overloaded word that means many",
    "things to many people. But by my",
    "definition where you know the true test",
    "is you get what you want out of life. It",
    "doesn't even have a life. It doesn't",
    "even want anything. It's a different",
    "thing. Um I do think it's unbelievably",
    "useful. I'm glad that it exists. You",
    "don't see it much yet in large scale",
    "production systems replacing humans",
    "because this tendency to hallucinate. So",
    "you can't put it into anything mission",
    "critical, confidently wrong one time out",
    "of 10. Correct. And it doesn't even know",
    "when it's wrong. Uh and maybe they'll",
    "get that one out of 10 down to one out",
    "of 100, but you'll kind of always want",
    "human oversight for critical critical",
    "things. I I always feel so bitter. It's",
    "I'm petty sometimes. My my less",
    "economist version of me is petty and I",
    "always want to like teach it a lesson if",
    "it gets something wrong. like how the",
    "[ __ ] like no you were so confident I'm",
    "treating it but I'm anthropomorizing",
    "anthropology it doesn't have a point of",
    "view and they are going to get a lot",
    "better and they might get to the point",
    "where the error rates are so low that",
    "you can put them into certain bounded",
    "problems like self-driving I think will",
    "be solved completely uh because it's a",
    "bounded problem cars don't you know go",
    "like off-road and drive through houses",
    "and stuff like that right so because and",
    "and same way like certain kinds of",
    "coding the creative side of coding I",
    "think doesn't go away I think if",
    "anything programmers get even more",
    "leverage and more powerful And rather",
    "than computing replacing programmers,",
    "programmers use AI to replace everybody",
    "else. On Tesla versus Whimo, would you",
    "bet on software or hardware for",
    "self-driving? Yeah. So the I think",
    "Tesla's in the stronger, longer term",
    "position, but it's hard to argue with",
    "what's working right now. And Whimo is",
    "working right now. So I would not",
    "underestimate them because there's a",
    "learning curve that you go through when",
    "you actually deploy something. And Whimo",
    "is way ahead in that regard. But Tesla's",
    "camera only approach if it works uh is a",
    "superior. It's much more scalable and",
    "Tesla knows how to print cars, right?",
    "They can just mass manufacture cars. But",
    "I think I think they'll both be around.",
    "They'll both be fine. It's everybody",
    "else who doesn't have a self-driving",
    "vehicle that's screwed.",
    "You mentioned uh kids there and you had",
    "a tweet that said, \"I'm not convinced",
    "that declining fertility needs to be",
    "proactively fought.\" I forgot that one.",
    "You're going to have to I'm I dug deep.",
    "Um why? Well, I mean, think back like",
    "what was it 30 years ago, 20 years ago?",
    "Everybody was saying overpopulation of",
    "the earth is going to be a problem.",
    "Malthusian ending, we're going to have",
    "too many people. And now all of a sudden",
    "we're going to have too few people. So",
    "part of it is just the doomerism meme is",
    "always alive and well, right? Or it just",
    "gets repackaged. Yeah. We're running out",
    "of oil. We have too much oil, right? You",
    "know, it's like the world is cooling,",
    "the world is warming. Like there's",
    "always something to scream about. The",
    "world is ending. Uh there's no progress",
    "in technology. AI is going to blow up",
    "the world, right? So people tend to",
    "overdo in both directions. Now, what is",
    "the actual fertility problem, right?",
    "Well, people are having less kids. Are",
    "they having less kids because there's a",
    "disease? Was there a virus? Did they",
    "lose their fertility? The microplastics",
    "in the testicles, right? No, it's people",
    "are having less kids because they're",
    "choosing to have less kids, right? Women",
    "have gotten emancipation, independence",
    "in the workforce, and they're making",
    "more money. Um, people don't need kids",
    "as insurance policies. They have less",
    "kids. Maybe they're living hedonistic",
    "lives. God bless them, right? They want",
    "to have more fun. They want to have less",
    "kids. I don't see the act of choosing to",
    "have less kids as a problem. Okay, so",
    "let's move one level up. Uh it's because",
    "of retirees. It's because a large",
    "percentage of the population is",
    "essentially retiring at the guaranteed",
    "age of 65 or 70 thanks social security.",
    "And so they need other people to pay for",
    "it. They need more workers in the",
    "workforce. And if the workforce is",
    "shrinking, then you have a small number",
    "of people Exactly. who are supporting a",
    "large number of retirees. And in",
    "democracies, you can't take pensions",
    "away. The voters vote you out. So they",
    "slowly strangle the economy. So what do",
    "you do? Then you have a bunch of",
    "immigration and then the whole culture",
    "changes. You end up in a low trust",
    "society and people start fighting over",
    "limited resources and how do you control",
    "which immigrants come in and how do you",
    "make sure that they're good taxpayers",
    "after they're in and so on. So you end",
    "up with in in kind of this trap where",
    "the low fertility rate is upstream of",
    "the downstream problems that are",
    "cultural and societal.",
    "But I'm not sure that you're going to",
    "solve that by making people have more",
    "kids. How are you going to meme them",
    "into having more kids? And I'm not even",
    "sure it's necessarily a problem because",
    "keep in mind, you have more resources",
    "now. You have less of a burden. Now,",
    "there's there's a flip side where every",
    "kid is a lottery ticket and an",
    "invention. So, there's some benefit to",
    "having more kids, but you can't you",
    "can't force it. I think it'll work",
    "itself out, right? The Scott Adams has",
    "this great law which calls the Adams law",
    "of slowmoving disasters. When disasters",
    "are very slowm moving like peak oil or",
    "global warming or population collapse",
    "and everyone can kind of see them coming",
    "economics and society as a force solve",
    "them because enough individual people",
    "has incentives to go solve them. So I",
    "don't know exactly how it gets solved",
    "but I think it could get solved in",
    "various ways. Uh, one example could be,",
    "um, you know, maybe people retire later.",
    "Maybe AI and automation and robots take",
    "care of the older people. Maybe we",
    "figure out how to have immigrants while",
    "still keeping a high trust society. We",
    "kind of put more rules around",
    "immigration that protects some of the",
    "high trust benefits. Maybe we outsource",
    "more things. Maybe we just, you know,",
    "have more land and housing to go around.",
    "Believe me, if we were having too many",
    "kids, everybody be complaining about how",
    "there's no housing and there's no land,",
    "right? So, they'll always find something",
    "to care about. So, I just don't view",
    "this as like a thing that any individual",
    "or government action is going to solve.",
    "I think economics and incentives over",
    "time will solve it. And I'm not even",
    "convinced it's like that big of a",
    "problem. Is there anything that you do",
    "think is a it may be selfcorrecting too,",
    "which is that if there are too few kids",
    "in society and the returns to having",
    "kids literally might just go up. It",
    "might just be easier to have the",
    "incentive to now have a child because",
    "there's so few around, they're going to",
    "get the best job. They're going to have",
    "opportunity resources. It's like",
    "everyone wants to everyone's I suppose",
    "if you could come at it from a pain side",
    "which is you look at all of the other",
    "people around who don't have kids. Let's",
    "say that um pensions completely drop off",
    "and the only way that old people are",
    "able to survive is if their children pay",
    "them some sort of stipend like reverse",
    "you know send send money back up the",
    "generations. You go okay well that's a",
    "pretty [ __ ] good incentive. That's a",
    "good incentive. I also think that people",
    "have been me'd into thinking that uh",
    "kids make your life worse and that's a",
    "that's a pretty pretty bad what's your",
    "experience been? Kids make your life",
    "better in every possible way. If you",
    "want to if you want an automatic",
    "built-in meaning to life, have kids. Uh,",
    "and I think there are these bad psych",
    "studies, like most psych studies,",
    "unfortunately, that say that people are",
    "unhappy when they have kids. Yeah, it's",
    "because you're catching in the middle of",
    "changing a diaper and you're saying",
    "like, \"Are you glad you had kids or",
    "not?\" Or or they don't even say that.",
    "They say, \"Are you happy or not?\" And",
    "they say, \"No, I'm not happy right now.\"",
    "But what they don't realize is that",
    "person has found something more",
    "important than being happy in the",
    "moment. They found meaning. And the",
    "meaning comes from kids. And if you ask",
    "parents, do you regret having kids? I",
    "think it would be 99 to1 against, you",
    "know, it would be, \"No, I don't regret",
    "having kids. I love having kids. I'm so",
    "glad I had kids.\" It's it's incredibly",
    "rare to meet a parent that regretted",
    "having children. It's pretty good odds.",
    "It's it's extremely good odds. And I",
    "think so I think I think a lot of people",
    "get late into life and uh you know, then",
    "they can't admit that they didn't want",
    "kids that that that they should have had",
    "kids. It's kind of late in the game. Um,",
    "but you know, a lot of times you see",
    "everybody who has a pet, right? Uh, and",
    "they're pushing them around in a",
    "stroller, right? What is that? That's a",
    "sublimated desire for children. Yeah.",
    "Uh, Malcolm Collins says that uh, having",
    "a pet is to children is using porn is to",
    "sex. He basically thinks that it's sort",
    "of a surrogate. It It's definitely in",
    "that direction. And, you know, I like",
    "pets. I like animals. I don't but I",
    "don't like the idea of like neutering or",
    "spaying something and then keeping it as",
    "a prisoner in the house and having to",
    "train it. You know, it's just I don't",
    "want to be responsible for that. Given",
    "that you've been thinking more about",
    "child rearing kids, what do you hope",
    "that your kids learn from their",
    "childhood?",
    "They should just be happy and do what",
    "they want. I don't I don't I don't have",
    "particular goals in mind for them. I",
    "think that's a that's another route to",
    "unhappiness. Having That's different",
    "though, right? Than learn versus goals.",
    "It's not necessarily what do they want?",
    "What what do you want them to want out",
    "of life? Like what is it that you had",
    "that idea around your number one job as",
    "a parent is to provide unconditional",
    "love to your kids. Yeah, that's it.",
    "Right. So, I can be loved or I am loved",
    "unconditionally. Is that one of the",
    "things? I want my kids to feel",
    "unconditionally loved and I want them to",
    "have high self-esteem.",
    "Mhm. As a consequence of that, but I",
    "don't get to choose any All I get to",
    "choose is my output. I can output love.",
    "I can't choose what they feel. I can't",
    "choose how they behave. I can't choose",
    "what they want. I can't choose what they",
    "turn out to be. And downstream from",
    "that, there should be freedom. There",
    "should be a degree of freedom that comes",
    "from the self-esteem that comes from the",
    "unconditionality. They should make their",
    "own mistakes and learn their own lessons",
    "and uh have their own desires and",
    "fulfill them as is appropriate. Uh I",
    "like any parent, I wouldn't want them to",
    "be hurt. I wouldn't want them to be",
    "unhappy. But I cannot control these",
    "things. Uh you replied to my friend Rob",
    "Henderson. He was talking about um how",
    "kids fall asleep more quickly when",
    "they're being carried and uh you said",
    "cry it out and co-sleeping is dangerous.",
    "What's IYI science? IY is Nim TB. He",
    "talk about intellectual yet idiot. These",
    "are people who are overeducated and they",
    "deny like basic common sense. Okay. Uh",
    "so there's a lot of that that goes on in",
    "child rearing uh thanks to really bad",
    "studies uh and and bad public medical",
    "directives. So, for example, you know,",
    "uh a few uh a few parents you maybe",
    "they're drunk or they're high or they're",
    "just other issues and you know, they",
    "roll over their kid when they're",
    "sleeping, the kid suffocates or they",
    "neglect their kid and then is that",
    "co-sleeping having them in the bed.",
    "Yeah. Exactly. Or or there, you know,",
    "the the modern proclamation. And so,",
    "because of that, they say, \"Well, don't",
    "co-sleep with your kids.\" Well, the kids",
    "in every society through all of human",
    "history co-slept with their parents.",
    "Where else do you think they were",
    "sleeping? They weren't houses in",
    "multiple rooms. Yeah. Exactly. Put in",
    "the other tent. We'll put It's just",
    "nonsense. Co-sleeping has been around",
    "since the dawn of time. So has uh",
    "feeding kids cow milk when or goat milk",
    "when breast milk is runs out or is not",
    "available. Um yet we're told formula,",
    "you know, made with soy and and and corn",
    "syrup, which was invented recently, is",
    "somehow better than uh cow milk. And cow",
    "milk can be dangerous for your kids and",
    "co-sleeping is dangerous for your kids",
    "and cry it out is the right answer. All",
    "of that is nonsense. I mean, it's very",
    "clear that um we raise children",
    "throughout human history without uh",
    "these interventions. And and to me, the",
    "idea that like you're going to let your",
    "kid cry it out, I get why that's done",
    "for practical reasons so that you know",
    "you can get some sleep and you can go to",
    "work in the morning, but the reality is",
    "when you let the kid cry it out, you're",
    "letting the kid ball until it finally",
    "gives up. I mean, the kid left by itself",
    "to cry it out in the wild. It's going to",
    "get it's going to get eaten, right? It's",
    "going to get eaten by a tiger. Um, so",
    "this kid is starting off on the wrong",
    "foundation. The the one I mentioned",
    "earlier about the idea that babies don't",
    "feel pain. Like that's ludicrous, right?",
    "Um, I've never heard that before. That's",
    "such a wild idea. Yeah, I'm not saying",
    "that's 100% true. I read it on the child",
    "in the cheek quite hard. And that's an",
    "academy. I read it on Twitter and I did",
    "one level confirmation on it, but it's",
    "so ludicrous that I should probably do",
    "two or three level confirmations on it",
    "before I talk about it. Um, but there",
    "are definitely some people who believe",
    "that there enough that it was a thing.",
    "um in certain circles for a while. But I",
    "think we just go through these, you",
    "know, the these IYI beliefs, these",
    "intellectual beliefs come from people",
    "who uh take a little bit of knowledge",
    "and extrapolate it too far. They think",
    "we know more than we know due to recent",
    "scientific studies and these are junk",
    "science. These are low power studies on",
    "uh you know on very certain contexts",
    "that then get over applied. Behavioral",
    "psych is very guilty of this but it's",
    "true across a lot of science. Um, so",
    "even with science, you have to be",
    "skeptical. You have to look very",
    "carefully at, you know, does it apply in",
    "the right context or not? Is it come",
    "from good sources? Did they run enough",
    "highpowered studies widely accepted? And",
    "there are a whole bunch of things you're",
    "just not supposed to talk about. You're",
    "not supposed to say like you don't say",
    "like you you can you can't say anything",
    "negative about vaccines because god",
    "forbid what if they don't get the polio",
    "vaccine, right? And that's part of the",
    "reason why the recent vaccine debate",
    "because we've taken our worship for",
    "vaccines too far because we don't want",
    "people to not take non-essential",
    "vaccines. So it gets overdone. So the",
    "same way there's this whole SIDS thing,",
    "sudden infant death syndrome, right?",
    "It's like no, there's kids don't",
    "suddenly mysteriously die. Like more",
    "likely there was neglect or there was a",
    "problem and then whoever was the",
    "caretaker doesn't want to admit to the",
    "problem or didn't recognize the problem,",
    "but kids don't just spontaneously die in",
    "the crib, right? Um so they talk about",
    "swaddling babies. You swaddle babies,",
    "you know, basically tie them up, mummify",
    "them. Uh so you constrict them so they",
    "die of SIDS where they roll over and",
    "they can't get back. I mean, it's just",
    "all this craziness around fundraising.",
    "It's a real minefield. It's a minefield.",
    "And and and you know, you have these",
    "scared parents or having a kid for the",
    "first time and they open a book and they",
    "start reading how to raise children when",
    "I would argue that your natural",
    "instincts on what to do with your child",
    "uh are actually pretty good. It It's",
    "funny when uh my wife and I had our",
    "first baby. I remember, you know, at the",
    "hospital, sorry, the first one was",
    "natural birth um at the birthing center.",
    "We we went home. I was like, \"There you",
    "go, that's it.\" And we're like, what do",
    "we do? Where's the instruction manual?",
    "You take them home and then you relax",
    "and you realize",
    "actually instincts are pretty good. You",
    "know, if the kid cries, check to see if",
    "they clean, feed them, all that. It's",
    "like your your basic instincts are",
    "actually very very good. And kids",
    "instincts are actually very very good.",
    "They know what they want and they want",
    "things for a reason and they can",
    "encourage you to give it to them. Yes.",
    "It's usually it children are not",
    "deficient adults who can't reason. Uh",
    "and to some extent that's true but",
    "mostly it's not true. Mostly they have",
    "very good reasons for what they want and",
    "you as a parent mostly have",
    "communication problems with them. They",
    "can't yet communicate to you. You can't",
    "communicate to them. They can't",
    "communicate to you. So early on with my",
    "kids, I tried to focus on teaching them,",
    "you know, basic explanatory theories as",
    "opposed to having them memorize things.",
    "That's just the most Yeah. the most nol",
    "solution. I'll give you I'll give you a",
    "very simple example, right? Okay. So",
    "this is Twitter and this is this is the",
    "how to get rich without getting lucky",
    "thread. So the first one well a simple",
    "one is you know how does knowledge get",
    "created? If you follow the critical",
    "rationalism David Deutsch philosophy,",
    "then it's by guessing and then by",
    "testing your guesses. So whenever they",
    "ask me something like, well, why do you",
    "think that is? Well, how would we figure",
    "out if that's true? Right? So that's a",
    "basic game you can play involving them.",
    "Involving them. But another one is that",
    "a lot of the rules that you teach kids",
    "have to do with hygiene, right? You must",
    "brush your teeth, you know, cover your",
    "mouth when you cough. Um, you know,",
    "clean up after yourself. Don't touch",
    "that. Wash your hands after you do this.",
    "um don't eat food off the floor, right?",
    "But all of these are subsumed under the",
    "germ theory of disease, right? So if you",
    "instead go on YouTube and show them",
    "videos of germs or if you have them look",
    "under a microscope at anything, they're",
    "like, \"Ah, they can infer what's going",
    "Yeah, there's creepy crawies everywhere",
    "and I got to watch out for them.\" Uh and",
    "then, you know, you can talk about how",
    "if you look at humans, like our real",
    "enemy are pathogens. I think a lot of",
    "aging and disease are actually",
    "downstream of our competition with",
    "pathogens over time. uh to a point that",
    "people still don't fully appreciate. Um",
    "there's a red queen hypothesis which is",
    "that we undergo sexual selection to mix",
    "up our genes. And so every 20 years,",
    "every generation, mix up your genes. But",
    "if you look at how bacteria and viruses",
    "mutate through just random mutations,",
    "their mixup rate on their genes and",
    "evolution rate is roughly the same as",
    "ours. Even though they go through",
    "thousands of generations, those 20",
    "years, because they're not doing sexual",
    "selection, they're doing asexual",
    "replication, mutation, their their",
    "evolutionary rate is roughly equivalent",
    "to ours. So, we're in a red queen race",
    "where we're both running at roughly the",
    "same speed using very different",
    "strategies. But a lot of how we're",
    "involved is around pathogens. Like our",
    "immune system is one of the most",
    "expensive things to run in the body is",
    "so much as about immune system",
    "optimization. That's about pathogens.",
    "junk DNA in bacteria and crisper was",
    "discovered because in bacteria their DNA",
    "is evolved to fight viruses and the way",
    "it does that is by taking viral DNA and",
    "snipping it up every time there's a",
    "viral attack and storing it in their own",
    "DNA so they have a copy so they can",
    "recognize it next time it attacks and",
    "you know and so on. Um a lot of the",
    "population structure of species uh",
    "determines how long their lifespans are.",
    "So very uh so if if in a given species",
    "there's a very high rate of infection",
    "then you'll have these older members of",
    "the population are carrying diseases",
    "that will then infect the young. So it's",
    "important for that species to get rid of",
    "the old faster. So the higher the",
    "disease rate in a given population, the",
    "less long live the entire population. So",
    "the older ones don't infect the younger",
    "ones. That's a hypothesis and I think",
    "it's true. It's an interesting",
    "hypothesis. um uh homeostasis within the",
    "human body, how we're always returning",
    "to a given level of things like that's a",
    "that's a fundamental part of our makeup,",
    "our temperature, pH, blood pressure, and",
    "so on under homeostasis. But if you if",
    "you engage in any kind of signaling like",
    "you take a peptide for example, that's a",
    "signaling molecule. You take a hormone",
    "externally, the body will counteract it.",
    "You take testosterone, the body will",
    "counteract will downregulate its own",
    "production very fast. Uh and the body",
    "releases its own hormones in pulses",
    "rather than steady state. Why is that?",
    "Well, that's because uh bacteria and",
    "viruses can infect your body and trick",
    "your body. They can take it over. Like",
    "toxoplasmosis does this, rabies does",
    "this. They take over macroscopic",
    "structure, structural bodies. And small",
    "bacteria and viruses would hack our",
    "bodies and literally take them over if",
    "we didn't have defense mechanisms. And",
    "one of those defense mechanisms is",
    "homeostasis. Anytime you see something",
    "getting out of whack, you immediately",
    "push back really hard on it because",
    "like, did I just get infected? Is",
    "something trying to take me over? It's",
    "also why hormones get released in pulses",
    "at night rather than in steady state low",
    "levels because uh enemy bacteria can",
    "release toxins or the same signaling",
    "molecules in small quantities but they",
    "can't pulse. They can't coordinate to",
    "pulse. So your body can coordinate to",
    "pulse as a macroscopic object but",
    "microscopic objects can't coordinate to",
    "create the same pulses. Oh that's cool.",
    "Yeah. So there's all I mean so you know",
    "that it's coming from you. Is that why?",
    "Correct. It's endogenous rather than",
    "exogenous. So I never knew that. And",
    "that's why we resist a lot of exogenous",
    "treatments. A lot of our medical",
    "treatments don't work. Um anyway, so",
    "this these are there's there's a bunch",
    "more I could go on, but I think that a",
    "lot of uh you know, you see this in",
    "cancers where uh a lot of uh bacteria",
    "show up like the Epstein bar virus shows",
    "up in a lot of cancers and um you know,",
    "now it seems like the gut microbiome",
    "influences so many things. Basically uh",
    "bacteria and viruses are at the top of",
    "the food chain compared to us. Like we",
    "are top of the well-known food chain,",
    "but bacteria and viruses eat us. Fungus",
    "eats us. So these microscopic predators",
    "are our natural predators. And so a lot",
    "of aging, societal structure, hygiene,",
    "religious strictctures against pork, you",
    "know, circumcision, all of these things.",
    "These are all designed to resist",
    "bacteria and viruses. So if you can",
    "teach children this philosophy at an",
    "early age, you shortcut all the debates.",
    "How effective have you been at teaching",
    "that philosophy to children? That one, I",
    "think I've been pretty effective. I've",
    "drilled that one at home. The one I",
    "haven't quite gotten around to yet is",
    "evolution. Like I'm starting to do",
    "little bits of that, you know, like we",
    "came from monkeys. What does that mean?",
    "Um already got them thinking about some",
    "of the deeper questions. I did ask my",
    "you know young son like uh you know, can",
    "nothing exist? I thought that was a fun",
    "question. So I like to throw a fun like",
    "four, three. No, no, he's he's eight.",
    "Oh, right. An 8-year-old and a",
    "six-year-old. So I asked them both like,",
    "\"Can nothing exist?\" And they had pretty",
    "good answers, right? Um, another one we",
    "played with the other day was like,",
    "\"What is the matrix?\" Okay. Uh, you",
    "know, what is what is this? What is all",
    "this? Um, I just find it and it's",
    "entertaining. It's just fun to talk",
    "about, right? To talk about these",
    "questions with your kids. I'm not saying",
    "that one is a good way of child raising.",
    "It's not leading to any deeper learning",
    "other than maybe just have them start uh",
    "or continue to question the basic",
    "structure of reality and not move past",
    "it so quickly. also to take joy. You",
    "know what's the meta lesson that's being",
    "taught there?",
    "Dad dad spends time asking questions to",
    "which there are not necessarily an",
    "answer because there is something",
    "enjoyable in the process of learning and",
    "trying to decipher what's happening",
    "possibly. Also, dad tries not too hard",
    "to teach people things. I don't want to",
    "be I don't want to be didactic. He helps",
    "them to arrive at it. Yeah. Correct.",
    "Correct. Dad Dad is here to help you",
    "solve problems when you have problems",
    "and you constantly have problems. So if",
    "you come to dad, dad can help explain to",
    "you how he would solve the problem. But",
    "most of the time they don't want that.",
    "Most of the time they just want most of",
    "the time they just want me to solve the",
    "problem, right? So sometimes they have",
    "to play it dumb. It's like why is my",
    "Wi-Fi not working on my computer? I'm",
    "like I don't know. Did you click on that",
    "thing? Look, you've got like a",
    "rebellious sovereign child. Sovereign as",
    "they may be, but sometimes they still",
    "need the dad to step in. So in addition",
    "to feeling loved and having high",
    "self-esteem, I think the most important",
    "trait that would be nice to not rob them",
    "of is agency. I want them to preserve",
    "their agency. They're born naturally",
    "agentic and willful, but a lot of child",
    "raising can beat that out of them by",
    "essentially domesticating them. That's",
    "right. And I would rather have wild",
    "animals and wolves than have",
    "well-trained dogs because I'm not going",
    "to be around to take care of them. Yeah.",
    "So, they're going to have to be able to",
    "look after themselves. Exactly. Yeah. A",
    "friend of mine, uh, Parsa on, uh, on Air",
    "Chat, uh, he had a great saying. He",
    "said, uh, he wants his, uh, children to",
    "be quick to learn and hard to kill.",
    "[Laughter]",
    "thought that was pretty good. Yeah, that",
    "was cool. I remember you saying just",
    "thinking about sort of future and",
    "culture and stuff like that. I remember",
    "you saying that the left had won the",
    "culture war and now they're just driving",
    "around shooting the survivors. Right.",
    "After the last 6 months of change that",
    "we've seen and sort of where we're at at",
    "the moment, what do you think the future",
    "of the culture war looks like? It's not",
    "over yet. Um they definitely won earlier",
    "rounds. They took over institutions. I",
    "think now it's much more of a fair fight",
    "um where you have people like Elon, you",
    "know, kind of supporting uh so so there",
    "there's these different forces through",
    "history, right? Historians will argue",
    "about this. Uh but there's a theory of",
    "the great man of history thing where",
    "it's like oh you have the Einsteins, you",
    "have the Teslas, you have the um the",
    "Jangaskhans and the Caesars, right? They",
    "determine the flow of history. And then",
    "there's the other uh point of view that",
    "no there are these massive forces at",
    "play you know demographics and geography",
    "and so on and then the particular great",
    "man doesn't matter they just come and go",
    "Napoleon doesn't matter they would have",
    "been somebody else uh the specific names",
    "are not important and because of kind of",
    "the leftist turn that our institutions",
    "took in the last few uh decades they now",
    "only subscribe to the great forces",
    "theory of history not the great man",
    "theory of history but I think now we're",
    "seeing the two play out where you're",
    "seeing you know Trump and Elon and other",
    "individuals is rising up and saying no,",
    "we resist. Yeah, that's interesting. And",
    "um I think that",
    "unfortunately and so the battle between",
    "kind of these these these collectivists",
    "and great forces versus individuals,",
    "it's as old as humanity itself. And and",
    "it is fundamental to the species. We are",
    "not a completely individualistic",
    "species. You know, no man is an island.",
    "A single person can't do anything by",
    "themselves. But we're also not a Borg.",
    "We're not a beehive. We're not an ant",
    "colony. We're not all just drones",
    "marching along. So, which is it? We",
    "we're somewhere in the middle. And the",
    "human race is always kind of bouncing",
    "between the two. We like strong leaders.",
    "We like to be led. Um we like to",
    "coordinate our forces and and and mass",
    "and and do things. Uh but at the same",
    "time, we're also all individuals and",
    "willing to break away and willing to do",
    "our own thing and everyone's always",
    "fighting to be a leader and there's",
    "always status games going on. So, u",
    "we're there's a pendulum that's always",
    "swinging back and forth. And in modern",
    "economics, the way that manifests is",
    "between sort of Marxism and capitalism,",
    "right? Marxism is like from each",
    "according to his ability to each",
    "according to his needs. We're all equal.",
    "There's a millennial project. We're all",
    "going to be equal in the end. And and",
    "you know, don't try and stand out, but",
    "do what's good for everybody. Um, and",
    "there's a religious aspect to it. And",
    "then the the capitalist individualist is",
    "like libertarian. Every man for himself.",
    "You just each do what you want and it'll",
    "work out for the greater good. That's",
    "Adam Smith. You know, the invisible hand",
    "of the market will feed you. the baker",
    "should bake and the butcher should",
    "butcher and the candlestick maker should",
    "make candlesticks and it'll all work",
    "out. Each person does their best and",
    "they trade and so which is it which",
    "which which theory is correct and I",
    "think there's always going to be a",
    "battle between the two",
    "and I",
    "think the interesting thing is what's",
    "going on there's a modern flavor to it",
    "which changes it. The modern flavor is",
    "that the individual is getting more",
    "powerful because they're becoming more",
    "leverage. So someone like an Elon Musk",
    "can have the leverage of tens of",
    "thousands of brilliant engineers and",
    "producers working for him. He can have",
    "factories of robots manufacturing",
    "things. He can have hundreds of billions",
    "of dollars of capital behind him and he",
    "can project himself through media to",
    "hundreds of millions of people. That is",
    "more power than any individual could",
    "have had historically. So the great men",
    "of history are becoming greater. That",
    "said, that same leverage is increasing",
    "the gap between the halves and have",
    "nots. So in the wealth game, more people",
    "are winning overall and the average is",
    "going up. But in the status game, there",
    "are essentially more losers. There are",
    "more invisible men and women who are",
    "getting nothing out of life and have no",
    "leverage. Relatively speaking.",
    "Objectively speaking, they might be",
    "better off. They still have phones and",
    "they still have TVs and they're not",
    "absolutist creatures though. We're",
    "relative creatures. Correct. And so to",
    "the extent that we're relatives",
    "creatures, there are more losers than",
    "winners. And in a democracy, those",
    "people will outnumber the winners and",
    "they will vote the winners down. Yep.",
    "Um, and so that's the battle that kind",
    "of goes on and the democracy has gotten",
    "very broad. And so one of my other quips",
    "is that um it's not the right to vote",
    "that gives you power, it's power that",
    "gives you the right to vote. So we've",
    "confused the two. So what happened was,",
    "you know, voting started as a way for",
    "people who had power to divide up the",
    "power, not fight amongst themselves. The",
    "winners of the revolution, the winners",
    "of the war, the people in the House of",
    "Lords and the House of Commons, they",
    "divide up power amongst themselves. to",
    "say, \"Hey, we have all the money. We",
    "have the power. We are the knights. We",
    "have the swords. We have the warriors.",
    "We could kill everybody, but we don't",
    "want to just fight each other all day",
    "long. We don't have to be Game of",
    "Thrones forever. So, we're going to",
    "divide up power by voting among",
    "ourselves.\" But then, as society goes on",
    "and becomes more and more peaceful, that",
    "franchise for voting gets spread. It",
    "gets spread to people who don't have",
    "land, who don't have power, who may not",
    "be able to inflict physical violence.",
    "And then eventually, you get to the",
    "point where everybody's voting.",
    "Everybody's voting. and everybody was",
    "voting for candy and fairies and you",
    "know all the free things in life. Uh and",
    "then eventually people start voting to",
    "oppress each other. The 51% in every in",
    "any domain vote to oppress the 49s, the",
    "tyranny, the majority. But not all of",
    "them are willing to back that up with",
    "physical power. And so you can end up in",
    "a situation where people who don't have",
    "physical power are using the",
    "institutions of the state to control the",
    "people who do have physical power. as a",
    "simple example taking the United States",
    "the people who don't have guns voting to",
    "disarm the people that do have guns",
    "right well if the people who do have",
    "guns get coordinated and care enough you",
    "can't do that right so I think",
    "eventually these societal structures are",
    "unstable they break down and they break",
    "down because eventually the people who",
    "have the power and say no wait a minute",
    "you don't get to vote you you only got",
    "to vote because you had power and now",
    "you don't have power and you're somehow",
    "trying to vote all of nature all of",
    "society all of capitalism all of human",
    "endeavors are underpinned by physical",
    "violence. And that is very hard truth to",
    "swallow and hard to get away from.",
    "Nature is read in tooth and claw. If you",
    "don't fight, you don't survive. You",
    "don't live, you die. And that's true of",
    "everything alive today. And humans are",
    "no different. So giving up physical",
    "power and then thinking you can exercise",
    "political power fails. Which is why",
    "every communist revolution, which is all",
    "about equality and kumbaya and brothers",
    "and sisters, end up being run by a bunch",
    "of thugs. Because if you don't have a",
    "way to divide up the wealth based on",
    "merit, then it's always going to be",
    "based on power and influence. The thugs",
    "with the guns always win in the end. So",
    "the question is just can you keep the",
    "thugs and the with the guns paid and",
    "happy and successful society where",
    "you're allocating based on merit because",
    "if you can't then you do it based on",
    "power. So I do think that this battle is",
    "not over but that's because it it never",
    "stopped. It's always been there from day",
    "one. It will continue. Is it a battle to",
    "not care about the news in an age of",
    "news saturation? All of this stuff,",
    "headlines 24 hours a day, streamed",
    "directly into your consciousness through",
    "a device in your pocket. You know, a lot",
    "of what we've spoken about today is",
    "freedom. Freedom from having to think",
    "about things or care about things that",
    "you do not have control over or that you",
    "shouldn't or that you don't want to. And",
    "yet people are just like submerged up to",
    "the bottom of their nostrils basically",
    "drowning",
    "in worry. So how Yeah. Is it is it a",
    "battle to sort of stay out of the news",
    "when you're saturated in it? Yeah. I",
    "mean, as you're saying, the human brain",
    "has not evolved to handle all the",
    "world's emergencies breaking in real",
    "time and you can't care about everything",
    "and you'll go insane if you try. Um,",
    "doesn't mean you shouldn't care at all.",
    "There's no should. I mean, if you want",
    "to care, go ahead and care. I would just",
    "say that you're probably better off only",
    "caring about things that are local or",
    "things that you can affect. So, if you",
    "really care about something that's in",
    "the news, then by all means care about",
    "it, but make a difference. Go do",
    "something about it. uh and make sure",
    "that it's your overwhelming desire and",
    "you don't have five other desires at the",
    "same time. Um also just realize the",
    "consequences of it. You're going to be",
    "unhappy until that thing gets fixed and",
    "that thing will often be out of your",
    "control. Desire is a contract to be",
    "unhappy until you get what you want. But",
    "exactly for the most part that's",
    "something that is in your life. It's",
    "like till I lose the weight until I get",
    "the job. It can be outside too. Yeah. If",
    "it's until the carbon dioxide parts per",
    "million are below this particular",
    "number. It's like that's a that's a",
    "tough one. Or all the people with Trump",
    "derangement syndrome, right? He's living",
    "rentree in their heads and driving them",
    "insane. And I get it. I mean, there are",
    "politicians who have definitely driven",
    "me insane as well. Um, but it comes at a",
    "very high cost and it's something that",
    "is out of your control that you cannot",
    "really influence. Um, so it's probably",
    "good to at least be conscious of it. You",
    "mentioned uh historians before. One of",
    "my friends has a a question, his",
    "equivalent of uh Peter Thiel's question",
    "of uh what is it that you believe that",
    "most people would disagree with? His is",
    "what do you think is currently ignored",
    "by the media but will be studied by",
    "historians?",
    "You're asking me that question right",
    "now. What do I think is ignored by the",
    "media but will be studied by historians?",
    "Well, I",
    "mean the media is only focused",
    "on very timely things, right? So, it",
    "depends if you want to talk about timely",
    "or timeless, right? But as a as a simple",
    "example, if I just look at things that",
    "maybe the next five or 10 years that are",
    "going to make a massive difference that",
    "people are not focused enough",
    "on. Um, and I think within two years",
    "this will be obvious. So, like they make",
    "a prediction and predictions are tough,",
    "but and I have to eat it in a few years.",
    "Yeah, I'm going have to eat eat this in",
    "a few years. So, I'm probably wrong, but",
    "uh two things that I pay attention to um",
    "that I don't think uh a lot of people do",
    "pay attention to. Well, there's a",
    "couple. One is I think just how bad",
    "modern medicine is. I think people just",
    "put a lot more faith in modern medicine",
    "than is warranted. Like our best ideas",
    "for a lot of things are surgery, just",
    "cutting things out, right? Uh treating",
    "things that are extraneous like, oh, you",
    "don't really need a gallbladder, you",
    "don't really need an appendix or you",
    "don't really need tonsils. Oh, that's",
    "false. every the surplus requirement",
    "human body is very very efficient all",
    "those things are needed um you know so I",
    "think I think the state of modern",
    "medicine is still pretty bad we don't",
    "have many good explanatory theories in",
    "biology um we have germ theory disease",
    "we have um evolution we have uh cell",
    "theory we have DNA genetics um",
    "morphogenesis embryogenesis and not much",
    "else you know there's not much else",
    "everything else is rules of thumb",
    "memorization Affects B cuz affects C",
    "affects D but we don't understand the",
    "underlying explanation. It's all just",
    "words pointing to words pointing to",
    "words. So biology is still in a very",
    "sorry state and because we are not",
    "allowed to take risk that might kill",
    "people um we just don't experiment",
    "enough in biology. So a lot of",
    "treatments are just outright banned by",
    "large regulatory bodies. So we just",
    "don't have the innovation. So I think",
    "we're still in the stone age when it",
    "comes to biology and we got a long ways",
    "to go. Uh and I think people will look",
    "back agass at this and I think this is",
    "Brian Johnson's point. He's like you",
    "know let's be more more extreme. Let's",
    "try to live forever. It must be more",
    "experimental and I'll start as end of",
    "one and start experimenting on myself",
    "and um but even there I disagree with",
    "Brian on many things like you know",
    "taking huge amounts of supplements. I",
    "think we just don't know supplements",
    "outside of their natural context like",
    "just eat liver man right um but that's",
    "fine and and I wouldn't be vegan either",
    "but you know it's it's I I really",
    "appreciate that he's experimenting he's",
    "good naturatured about he shares",
    "everything so we need more people like",
    "that. Um so I think the state of biology",
    "people will look back and say wow that",
    "was in the dark ages. Um I think uh",
    "another uh another thing that we'll look",
    "back on is I think we we still continue",
    "to underestimate how important drones",
    "are going to be in warfare. The future",
    "of all warfare is drones. There will be",
    "nothing else on the battlefield. Um",
    "because I think of the end state of",
    "drones is autonomous bullets. Not even",
    "guided autonomous like they're",
    "self-directed. Uh, and so if that's the",
    "future we're headed towards, and that's",
    "a it is dist. Why would you have an",
    "armed force that's there's going to be",
    "no there's there's gonna be no aircraft",
    "carriers, there's going to be no tanks,",
    "there's going to be no infantry men,",
    "there's just going to be autonomous",
    "bullets. Buy autonomous bullets against",
    "your autonomous bullets. Whichever ones",
    "win, the other side just surrenders cuz",
    "it's over. Um, I think that's the second",
    "piece of it. I think a a a third piece",
    "that is going to be uh kind of",
    "unexpected is the GLP1s, which I know",
    "you and I have privately discussed",
    "before. I think these are the most",
    "breakthrough drugs since antibiotics.",
    "Um, they're probably more important than",
    "statins. They're sort of miracle drugs.",
    "They seem to the there there are",
    "downsides, but the downsides and side",
    "effects are so minor compared to the",
    "upsides beyond just weight loss. Um,",
    "they also seem to be addiction breakers.",
    "They seem to lower many kinds of cancer.",
    "They almost metabolically reverse aging",
    "up to a certain point. Um, and I think",
    "they're going to bend the curve on",
    "health care costs. And uh the big",
    "question people are going to be asking",
    "over the next 5 years is why are",
    "Americans paying thousands of dollars a",
    "month for this when people overseas are",
    "getting them for free or I can order",
    "them from China for free or whatever. Um",
    "and maybe it like if I were Bernie",
    "Sanders the platform I would be running",
    "on is I would say okay we're going to",
    "pay you know hundreds of billions of",
    "dollars to Novo and Eli Liy and we're",
    "just going to make these free or there's",
    "hundreds of analoges of these things",
    "that work. These are not going to be,",
    "you know, limited to just the few that",
    "are that are being used today. Just take",
    "one of them or two of them, make them",
    "free, and I think it'll make a big",
    "difference. And, uh, as you and I were",
    "discussing earlier, uh, this does bend a",
    "lot of people out of shape who got there",
    "the oldfashioned way, and they want to",
    "see obesity as a moral failing on",
    "people's parts and it lowers their",
    "status if they are suddenly signal is",
    "less of a signal. Yeah. Correct.",
    "Absolutely. Yeah. So, so they're",
    "incented to say, \"Oh, well, you don't",
    "know the downsides. you know, it's",
    "irresponsible to suggest it's going to",
    "cause cancer. Have fun losing bone and",
    "muscle mass. But none of that stuff is",
    "really true. The cancer stuff is",
    "actually beneficial on. I know people",
    "who are now taking these things for",
    "anti-aging reasons. Um they're already",
    "fit, but they just want to age better",
    "and have a stronger insulin metabolism.",
    "Um and there's evidence now these things",
    "are, you know, they put off dementia,",
    "Alzheimer's, colon cancer. It's insane.",
    "Cardiovascular disease, like the the",
    "list of benefits is insane. There's no",
    "free lunch.",
    "But this is a class of drugs that",
    "prevents you from taking other drugs",
    "into your body. It prevents you from",
    "taking uh you know too much sugar, too",
    "many calories in an era of abundance,",
    "prevents you from smoking, prevents you",
    "from even uh there's an organization",
    "called Casper that is now doing a study",
    "on heroin addictions and they're showing",
    "that this can lower opioid overdoses and",
    "heroin addiction. So there's a lot of",
    "overwhelming medical evidence coming out",
    "and I think I don't I don't know the",
    "exact number but I think something like",
    "10% of the population might not have",
    "tried these things. I think that's the",
    "number that I'd say as well. It's",
    "massive. I think it's about 50% of the",
    "population say that they would like to",
    "try it. Exactly. So uh I think the body",
    "positivity movement is dead and we",
    "always kind of knew it was a scam. I",
    "mean it's dying very very quickly. Yeah.",
    "Equipped like you can never be too rich,",
    "too thin or too clean, right? And",
    "immediately like a whole bunch of people",
    "went nonlinear my mention like what do",
    "you mean too thin and what about the",
    "hygiene hypothesis and you know",
    "obviously there's always exceptions but",
    "people want to be thin and fit and",
    "people want to be clean back to the",
    "pathogen discussion that we had. Um so I",
    "think overall that there's going to be",
    "huge demand for these things and our",
    "modern medical system is not built to",
    "supply these. Well, I'm not I'm not I",
    "don't hold it against the phases. I",
    "think the farmers did their job by",
    "creating the thing, but I think next we",
    "need to step up and figure out how to",
    "make it broadly and cheaply available as",
    "opposed to just milk it for only for,",
    "you know, people on obesity who can get",
    "Medicare to sign off for it or people",
    "paying out of pocket at very very high",
    "prices. Yeah. Um the the benefits of",
    "societal distribution of the safer GLP",
    "ones is so large that whichever",
    "politicians uh tackles that is going to",
    "be richly rewarded. Well, obesity is the",
    "number one source of malnutrition",
    "worldwide. There's twice as many people",
    "that are obese than are starving. So",
    "about half a billion people are starving",
    "in a billion. So many problems are",
    "downstream of that. Like you know, look",
    "at how much of the federal budget goes",
    "into dialysis because of kidney failure.",
    "And why is that? It's because of",
    "diabetes, right? So so many of the",
    "problems that we have in modern society",
    "are downstream of obesity. And you know",
    "this like fitness is so important. Uh",
    "and yes, there's in some people these",
    "things call mus cause muscle and bone",
    "loss, but not in the people who are",
    "eating high protein and working out",
    "hard. So it they can be taken a way",
    "that's safer. And some versions of these",
    "like literal glutai, the original one,",
    "they've been around for decades, and the",
    "others have been around for about a",
    "decade. So and we already have, as you",
    "said, 10% of the population taking them.",
    "So they're already quite widely",
    "distributed. A good sample size. Yeah,",
    "it's a great sample size. What more do",
    "you need? Like if if you if you have a",
    "bacterial infection that's eating you, I",
    "don't say, \"Oh, I have this antibiotic,",
    "but it's going to raise your blood",
    "pressure.\" It's like, \"No, take the",
    "antibiotic.\" If you're going to kill",
    "yourself, I say, \"Take this",
    "antisycchotic and stay alive a little",
    "longer and solve it.\" I don't say, \"Oh,",
    "it's going to, you know, cause your",
    "heart rate to go up by three beats a",
    "minute. I don't worry about that.\" So",
    "similarly, if you're poisoning yourself",
    "with toxins and overuse of substances",
    "that you shouldn't be using, either",
    "heroin, alcohol, cigarettes, sugar, or",
    "just sheer calories, um, take this GLP1.",
    "Uh, they also improve digestion. You",
    "just have less cal, just less food",
    "matter going through your stomach. They",
    "lower cancer risks across the board.",
    "There's quite a few cancers that lower.",
    "Um, cardiovasc I mean, I don't know what",
    "else to tell you. I've been very",
    "surprised by the negative reception",
    "whenever you have a conversation about",
    "GLP1s and I think a lot of it may be",
    "people who and you well think about how",
    "many sacred cows are being gored right",
    "all the people who are basically saying",
    "uh you should work harder you should be",
    "fit like I did right it's lowering their",
    "status think about all the nutritionists",
    "and doctors and trainers who are now",
    "being you know it's too easy they're",
    "being put out of business in a way right",
    "uh it's kind of like why does the",
    "American military keep buying aircraft",
    "carriers, right? In the age of drones,",
    "um there's an incentive bias. There's a",
    "very strong motivated reasoning. Uh but",
    "it doesn't matter. 10% people are on it.",
    "Uh everybody wants to be fit. It's going",
    "to spread like wildfire. M we I was just",
    "thinking as you were talking that you",
    "know when we think about health and a",
    "lot of people kind of get captured by",
    "the way that they were brought up the",
    "the the habits that they had from their",
    "childhood or what mom and dad did or",
    "genetic predisposition and stuff like",
    "that. I think um you have as many",
    "reasons as as many people to sort of",
    "feel hard done by by challenges that you",
    "had earlier on in in your life. Is",
    "getting past your past a skill? Sort of",
    "not being owned today by your history.",
    "Sort of not having that victimhood",
    "mentality. Yeah, I I did have a uh tough",
    "childhood, but I don't think about it.",
    "You know, I I think there are a couple",
    "of things going on there. One is I did",
    "process it quite a bit. I thought about",
    "it, but I thought about it to get rid of",
    "it. I didn't think about it to dwell on",
    "it or to like indulge. Yeah. I wanted to",
    "be successful. I wanted more than",
    "anything else to rise past that. And so",
    "I couldn't have that as a burden on me.",
    "So I had to get rid of it. So to the",
    "extent that I dealt with it, it was to",
    "it was for the express purpose of",
    "getting rid of it, not to create an",
    "identity or story or to reflect upon it",
    "or to say look at me, look at what I've",
    "accomplished and look how great I am and",
    "what I've done. So I got rid of it. And",
    "I think at some point you you wrestle",
    "with that thing and then you just",
    "realize like you're never going to",
    "untangle the whole thing. It's a Gordian",
    "knot problem. uh like Alexander you know",
    "found that tangled knot in India and uh",
    "they said oh the famous conqueror will",
    "come and will untie this knot nobody",
    "else can untie the knot and he took one",
    "look at it pulled out a sword and just",
    "cut it so at some point you just have to",
    "cut your past if your past is bothering",
    "you you will eventually get tired of",
    "trying to untangle that knot and you",
    "will just drop it because you will",
    "realize life is short and the more you",
    "have more you want to accomplish in this",
    "life actually the less time you have to",
    "unravel that thing so I just wanted to",
    "actually get things done so I had no",
    "time to deal with it. So, I just cut it.",
    "It's like a really bad relationship, but",
    "in this case, it's a bad relationship",
    "with your own history, so you just drop",
    "it. Yeah. I think, you know, so much of",
    "what we've spoken about today is on the",
    "shortness of life and uh the fact that",
    "every moment is precious. You had to",
    "take about um that the most fundamental",
    "resource in your life is not time, it's",
    "attention. That's right. I used to",
    "think, you know, the currency of life,",
    "right? People think it's money. And yes,",
    "money is important and it does let you",
    "trade certain things for time, but it",
    "doesn't really buy you time. Ask Warren",
    "Buffett how much time money can buy you",
    "or Michael Bloomberg. They're, you know,",
    "rich as Scrooge and and Chris, but they",
    "can't buy more time, right? Brian",
    "Johnson, notwithstanding. Um, so you",
    "can't trade money for time. Money is not",
    "the real currency of life.",
    "And time itself doesn't even mean that",
    "much because as we talked about before,",
    "a lot of time can be wasted because",
    "you're not really present for it. You're",
    "not paying attention. So the real",
    "currency of life is attention. It's what",
    "you choose to pay attention to and and",
    "and what you do about it. And so back to",
    "the point about the news media, you can",
    "put your attention on the news, but",
    "that's how you're spending the real",
    "currency of life. So just be aware of",
    "that. If you want to, that's fine.",
    "There's no there's no right or wrong",
    "here. Like maybe it is your destiny to",
    "pick something in the news, learn about",
    "that problem, adopt that problem, and",
    "solve it. But just be careful because",
    "your attention is the only thing that",
    "you have and that can also be captured",
    "by your own past. It Yes. You can",
    "fritter it away on anything you like. Is",
    "there an advantage to starting out as a",
    "loser? Uh absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. cuz if",
    "you're because if you're a loser then",
    "you'll want to be a winner and then",
    "you'll develop all the characteristics",
    "that will help you be a you know quote",
    "unquote winner in life. That said, I",
    "wouldn't sentence my kids to it. Like I",
    "don't think you can artificially do",
    "that. You know, it's it's sort of like",
    "imagine that you were you know 300 years",
    "ago you're born a surf and then somehow",
    "you managed to escape off the farm and",
    "you become a land owner and then",
    "eventually you become minor nobility and",
    "aristocrat. Are you going to put your",
    "kids back on the farm and say you're",
    "going to be a surf again? I know they",
    "all like those stories. the the kids",
    "themselves like those stories because it",
    "says I came from the school of hard",
    "knocks. My dad made me go shovel hay for",
    "a summer. It's not real. I mean, you're",
    "not going to trick them. Um, I think",
    "what you can all you can do is kind of",
    "uh cultivate an appreciation and",
    "gratitude for what you have. And the",
    "only way to do that is just evidence it",
    "yourself, right? Just show yourself how",
    "you spend money, how you respect it,",
    "what you do with it, how you take care",
    "of people, who you're responsible for.",
    "and and and the more resources you have,",
    "the greater the tribe you can take care",
    "of. The more of the tribe you can take",
    "care of. So when you have no resources,",
    "you're struggling to take care of",
    "yourself. And at that point, it's good",
    "to be selfish cuz you can't save",
    "somebody else if you can't even save",
    "yourself. Yes. So you take care of",
    "yourself and you become the best version",
    "of yourself. But there are too many men",
    "who are able, fit, and have some money",
    "who are doing nothing with their lives.",
    "They're just sitting at home doing",
    "nothing, just indulging in themselves.",
    "Maybe they go on dates and they get Door",
    "Dash. Like I have no respect for that. I",
    "think there's nothing worse in society",
    "than a lazy man because he's sort of",
    "he's sort of leaving it all on the",
    "table. He's leaving his potential on the",
    "table. It's bad for him. So the next",
    "thing you do is you go and you have a",
    "family and you take care of your family.",
    "Take care of that tribe. Then you take",
    "care of your extended family. You take",
    "care of your cousins, brothers, uncles,",
    "grandmothers, aunts, you know, sisters,",
    "everybody that you can. And then if you",
    "have more resources beyond that, then",
    "you go take care of your local tribe.",
    "You take care of your people. Um you",
    "start trying to do some good for the",
    "world. And if you have more resource",
    "than that, you go take care of an even",
    "bigger tribe. And that's how you earn",
    "both respect and self-confidence and you",
    "live up to your potential. So the the",
    "more you have, the more is rightfully",
    "expected of you. And I think it's a good",
    "compact with society when highly capable",
    "people express and flex that capability",
    "by giving more and more and by doing",
    "more and more. And society rewards them",
    "with the one thing they can't get",
    "otherwise which is status. Right? So",
    "society should give you status in",
    "exchange for it. Um, they should say,",
    "\"Okay, you did a good job. You took care",
    "of more people than than just yourself",
    "and just the people immediately around",
    "you.\" Uh, and that's what an alpha male",
    "to me is. An alpha male is not the one",
    "who gets to eat first. The alpha male",
    "eats last. The alpha male feeds",
    "everybody else first and then gets to",
    "eat last. And they do that out of their",
    "own self-respect and pride. And society",
    "rewards them by calling them an alpha",
    "and giving them status. I wonder whether",
    "some of the push back that we've got",
    "against uh rich, wealthy, powerful",
    "people is disincentivizing. Uh it is",
    "like who was it? Zuck who you know",
    "donated money at Zuckerberg General's",
    "hospital and they wanted to pull his",
    "name off of it. I mean that's I didn't",
    "see that but that's that kind of stuff",
    "backfires right? You you should reward",
    "people for doing what were you saying",
    "before you don't just need to in fact",
    "actually actively avoid castigating",
    "people if you want their behavior to",
    "change when they get something wrong.",
    "Look at reinforcing it when they get",
    "something right. It's happening at a a",
    "societal level as well. Correct. I mean,",
    "like the the guys who make a lot of",
    "money and go out and buy sports teams, I",
    "wouldn't do that, right? But the one who",
    "goes out and builds a hospital or builds",
    "a rocket to take people to the moon, uh,",
    "you know, rescue some astronauts, you",
    "should be rewarding him for that. Mhm.",
    "Naval, I really appreciate you. Uh, I",
    "hope that this has lived up to whatever",
    "weird daydreams you've been having.",
    "Um, what have you got coming up? What",
    "can people expect from you over the next",
    "however long? Expect nothing. That's the",
    "most naval way that we could have",
    "finished this, dude. It's uh it's been a",
    "long time coming and I really do",
    "appreciate you for being here today. But",
    "I do hope you deliver something. Oh, I",
    "think you have. So, thank you. Thanks",
    "for having me. Thank you, too. Thanks",
    "for getting in my mind. And hopefully",
    "now you're out. We'll see. Maybe even",
    "worse now you've got the real memories",
    "to stick. I don't know. The reason to",
    "win the game is to be free of it. The",
    "reason the reason to do the podcast is",
    "to be is to be done with it.",
    "All right. Wow. You made it to the end.",
    "Congratulations. Well, if you enjoyed",
    "that, you're going to love my fulllength",

    "one boom all right we're live thank you",
    "very much for doing this man i really",
    "appreciate it i've been absorbing your",
    "information and listening to you talk",
    "for uh quite a while now so it's uh it's",
    "great to actually meet you thanks for",
    "having me my pleasure my pleasure you",
    "are one of the rare guys",
    "that is uh you're a big investor",
    "you are um you're deep in the tech world",
    "but yet you seem to have a very balanced",
    "perspective in terms of how to live life",
    "as opposed to not just be",
    "entirely focused on",
    "success and financial success",
    "and",
    "tech investing but rather",
    "how to live your life in a happy way",
    "that's a it's a it's not balance",
    "yeah you know i think the reason why",
    "people like uh hearing me is because",
    "like if it's like if you go to a circus",
    "and you see a bear right that's kind of",
    "interesting but not that much if you see",
    "a unicycle that's interesting but you",
    "see a bear on a unicycle that's really",
    "interesting right",
    "so when you combine things you're not",
    "supposed to combine right people get",
    "interested it's like bruce lee right",
    "striking thoughts philosophy plus",
    "martial arts",
    "and i think it's because at some level",
    "all humans are broad we're all",
    "multivariate but we get summarized in",
    "pithy ways in our lives and at some deep",
    "level we know that's not true right",
    "every human basically is capable of",
    "every experience and every thought uh",
    "you know you're ufc comedian commentator",
    "podcaster but you're also more than that",
    "you're also father",
    "uh lover you know thinker etc",
    "so i like the model of life that the",
    "ancients had the greeks the romans right",
    "where you would start out and when",
    "you're young you're just like going to",
    "school then you're going to war then",
    "you're running a business then you're",
    "supposed to serve in the senate or the",
    "government then you become a philosopher",
    "there's sort of this arc to life",
    "where you try your hand at everything",
    "and as one of my friends says",
    "specialization is for insects right",
    "so everyone should just be able to do",
    "everything and so i don't believe in",
    "this model anymore of trying to focus",
    "your life down on one thing you've got",
    "one life just do everything you're going",
    "to do",
    "i couldn't agree more and i i think that",
    "sometimes people find certain success in",
    "whatever the endeavor is and then they",
    "think that that is their niche and they",
    "stick with it and they never change and",
    "they almost out of fear",
    "well it's hard because there's a you",
    "know the analogy around mountain",
    "climbing like if you find a mountain and",
    "you start climbing you spend your whole",
    "life climbing it and you get say two",
    "thirds of the way and then you see the",
    "peak is like way up there but you're two",
    "thirds of the way up you're still really",
    "high up but now to go the rest of the",
    "way you're going to have to go back down",
    "to the bottom and look for another path",
    "nobody wants to do that people don't",
    "want to start over yeah and it's the",
    "nature of later in life that you just",
    "don't know the time",
    "so it's very painful to go back down and",
    "look for a new path but that may be the",
    "best thing to do and that's why when you",
    "look at the greatest artists uh and and",
    "creators they have this ability to start",
    "over that nobody else does like elon",
    "will you know be called an idiot and",
    "start over doing something brand new",
    "that he supposedly is not qualified for",
    "or when madonna or paul simon or you two",
    "come out with a new album their existing",
    "fans usually hate it because they've",
    "adopted a completely new style that",
    "they've learned somewhere else and a lot",
    "of times they'll just miss completely so",
    "you have to be willing to be a fool",
    "and kind of have that beginner's mind",
    "and go back to the beginning to start",
    "over if you're not doing that you're",
    "just getting older yeah i mean i don't",
    "even know if it's willing to be a fool",
    "it's just to me that the most exciting",
    "thing is to try to get better at",
    "something to learn",
    "things i mean it's really exciting when",
    "you just have incremental progress and",
    "something that you're completely new to",
    "yeah i live for the aha moment that",
    "moment when you connect two things",
    "together that you hadn't connected",
    "together before and it fits nicely and",
    "solidly and it kind of helps form a",
    "steel framework of understanding in your",
    "mind that you can then hang other ideas",
    "off of that's what i live for yeah it's",
    "like curiosity fulfilled and it's what",
    "little children do too you know my",
    "little son is always asking why why why",
    "why why and i always try and answer him",
    "and half the times i realize actually i",
    "don't really understand why i just have",
    "a memorized answer for you but that's",
    "not really understanding",
    "yeah those are weird conversations right",
    "when you're you're talking to your kids",
    "and you say look uh the reality is i",
    "don't know a lot of things yes i've just",
    "memorized a lot of things",
    "and there's certain things that you just",
    "can't know yeah you realize that you",
    "know you have",
    "you have answers for a few things that",
    "you've thought through then you sort of",
    "have cover-ups like like trap doors like",
    "don't go here this is just a cover-up i",
    "don't really know the answer to what the",
    "meaning of life is or how we got here",
    "yes and then you've got a whole bunch of",
    "memorized stuff because a lot of your uh",
    "a lot of intelligence these days just",
    "the external brain pack of civilization",
    "i know it's out there i know the answers",
    "are out there know how to look them up",
    "and i've memorized some of them and i i",
    "kind of understand how money works and",
    "the federal reserve prints it and what",
    "this government thing is but not really",
    "right",
    "so not good enough to teach it in",
    "university yeah yeah",
    "uh",
    "i think people do that with almost",
    "everything in life these days in terms",
    "of like have a like a one page a one",
    "cheat like a brief summary of what and",
    "the explanation for what this very",
    "complex subject might be tldr right",
    "don't give me the don't give me the",
    "lecture give me the book don't give me",
    "the book give me the blog post don't",
    "give me the blog post give me the tweet",
    "don't give me the tweet i just i already",
    "know yeah i got really fascinated by the",
    "way you read because i thought there was",
    "something wrong with me by doing that",
    "but you you don't really just read a",
    "book to completion you read and then you",
    "pick something else up and you just kind",
    "of go based on your whims whatever",
    "you're interested in well i was raised",
    "by my i was raised by a single mom in",
    "new york and she used the local library",
    "as a daycare center because it was a",
    "very tough neighborhood and so she would",
    "basically say when you get back from",
    "school go straight to the library and",
    "don't come out",
    "until i pick you up late at night so i",
    "used to basically live in the library",
    "and i read everything i read every",
    "magazine i read every pictograph or",
    "every book or every map i just ran out",
    "of stuff to read i just read everything",
    "so i got over this idea of",
    "that reading a large number of books or",
    "reading a book to completion as a vanity",
    "metric because really",
    "when people are putting up photos on",
    "twitter instagram of look at my pile of",
    "books that i'm reading it's a show-off",
    "thing it's a signaling thing yeah sure",
    "and the reality is i would rather read",
    "the best hundred books over and over",
    "again until i absorb them rather than",
    "read all the books right yeah because",
    "your your brain has finite information",
    "in a finite space",
    "you get enough advice it all cancels to",
    "zero",
    "there's a lot of nonsense in books out",
    "there too so",
    "i don't read anymore to complete books i",
    "read to satisfy my genuine intellectual",
    "curiosity",
    "and it can be anything it could be",
    "nonsense it could be history could be",
    "fiction it could be science it could be",
    "sci-fi these days it's mostly sci-fi",
    "philosophy science because that's just",
    "what i'm interested in",
    "but i will read for understanding so a",
    "really good book i will flip through i",
    "won't actually read it consecutively in",
    "order and i won't even just even finish",
    "it i'm looking for ideas things that i",
    "don't understand and when i find",
    "something really interesting i'll",
    "reflect on it i'll research it",
    "and then when i'm bored of it i'll drop",
    "it or i'll flip to another book",
    "thanks to electronic books i've got 50",
    "70 books open at any time in my kindle",
    "or ibooks and i'm just bouncing around",
    "between them",
    "it's also a little bit of a defense",
    "mechanism to how in modern society we",
    "get too much information too quickly and",
    "so our attention spans are very low so",
    "you get twitter you get instagram you",
    "get facebook you're just used to being",
    "bombarded with information so you can",
    "take that to you you can view that as a",
    "negative and be like i have no attention",
    "span or you could view that as a",
    "positive i multitask really well and i",
    "can dig really fast i can if i find a",
    "thread that's interesting i can follow",
    "it through five social networks through",
    "the web through the libraries through",
    "the books and i can really get to the",
    "bottom of this thing very quickly it's",
    "like the library of alexandria that i",
    "can research at my disposal so i i no",
    "longer track books read or even care",
    "about books read it's about",
    "understanding concepts yeah you brought",
    "up two awesome points first of all the",
    "the social media aspect of of books and",
    "basically anything it's like",
    "it's such a weird way to display your",
    "life because it's you know you're",
    "displaying the best aspects of your life",
    "and some sort of a glass",
    "case",
    "you know just it's an unrealistic",
    "version of your life that you cultivate",
    "and you curate",
    "and i'm i'm as guilty of that as anybody",
    "everybody's guilty of it i'm guilty of",
    "it too yeah you know i mean i pose with",
    "my dog every time i run",
    "yeah we're always signaling yeah it's",
    "like rather than really looking at",
    "yourself you're looking at how other",
    "people look at you so it's like this one",
    "remove mental image and it's kind of a",
    "disease because social media is making",
    "celebrities of all of us and celebrities",
    "the most miserable people in the world",
    "right because they're this strong",
    "self-image that gets built up it gets",
    "built up by compliments every time",
    "somebody pays you or me a compliment and",
    "we're like oh well thank you right then",
    "that builds up an image of who we are",
    "and then one idiot comes along one out",
    "of ten one out of a hundred and they can",
    "easily tear it down because it doesn't",
    "take many insults to cancel out a lot of",
    "compliments and now you're carrying",
    "around this big weighty self-image and",
    "it's just very easy to be attacked and",
    "because you're you're famous or you're",
    "well known people want to attack you so",
    "being a celebrity is no good it's",
    "actually a problem",
    "like one of my tweets is and these are",
    "all reminders to myself is you want to",
    "be rich and anonymous not poor and",
    "famous",
    "there's benefits to it of course of",
    "course but we wouldn't do it it has",
    "unusual",
    "problems that you don't get trained for",
    "and you really will not understand",
    "unless you experience it you know i was",
    "having this conversation with my wife we",
    "were talking about um people that just",
    "come up to you and they don't care what",
    "you're doing they don't care if i'm with",
    "my daughter if i'm holding her if i'm",
    "feeding her for you know we're in the",
    "middle of an intense conversation she's",
    "crying she could be crying and some bro",
    "will come over and just immediately have",
    "to take a picture doesn't care his needs",
    "supersede the daughter",
    "and my wife was saying i that before she",
    "knew me she used to think that that's",
    "just part of the price of being famous",
    "that people people like you that's just",
    "part of the price being famous and now",
    "when it interrupts her life and you know",
    "it interrupts the children and it",
    "interrupts friends and you know she now",
    "she's like this is annoying like this is",
    "not this is not healthy this is not a",
    "smart way to to interact with people and",
    "that people have this weird challenge",
    "this weird thing that if you're if you",
    "become famous there's this weird",
    "challenge where people just want to come",
    "to you especially today because if they",
    "can get a photo of you then that boosts",
    "their social media profile",
    "like hey i'm sitting here with the vault",
    "look at that smile",
    "anonymity is a privilege on the other",
    "hand it's self-inflicted i mean we",
    "brought it on ourselves yeah we don't",
    "think we knew what it was though we did",
    "but we carry on so yeah",
    "it tells us we are getting something out",
    "of it so i you know there are times when",
    "someone will approach me in public and",
    "i'm a little resentful and there are",
    "other times i'm just like actually i'm",
    "really grateful that you know i worked",
    "for this i got this right this is the",
    "payoff just embrace it smile grit and",
    "bear it but you have a different sort of",
    "celebrity too right you're you're a hero",
    "amongst investors",
    "and amongst i mean you've just i'm a",
    "hero",
    "among young male geeks",
    "which is those are some of my favorite",
    "people right but that's not the kind of",
    "celebrity i think most people set out to",
    "get especially most guys right right",
    "right you want the cute females yeah",
    "yeah i look at my brief little youtube",
    "clips i have a tiny little podcast going",
    "now and it's like 95 mail oh sure yeah",
    "this is very highly 18 to 35. yeah we",
    "what do we what is the numbers",
    "yeah it's in the 90s yeah um you you did",
    "that one you do that one very small",
    "podcast where you just have small like",
    "three or four minute clips",
    "yeah so what it was i i did a tweet",
    "storm uh called how to get rich without",
    "getting lucky and it got pretty popular",
    "in twitter and it's really about wealth",
    "creation i just use the clickbaity title",
    "and it's trying to basically lay out",
    "timeless principles of wealth creation",
    "that if you absorb them you become the",
    "kind of person who can create wealth",
    "create business make money",
    "and my theory behind that is like",
    "there are three things everybody wants",
    "there's actually more than three but",
    "let's just start with three the three",
    "basics everybody wants to be wealthy",
    "everybody wants to be happy and",
    "everybody wants to be fit",
    "and i know there's a lot of virtue",
    "signal that goes on like we don't want",
    "to money and you know i don't care about",
    "being happy and happiness is for stupid",
    "people but let's face it like you want",
    "to be rich and happy and healthy that's",
    "the trifecta now of course you also want",
    "an internally calm state of mind you",
    "want a loving household so there are",
    "other things that come into it but those",
    "three i think",
    "they can actually be taught right and",
    "the fitness i'm not going to teach there",
    "are a lot of people who you've had on",
    "here including yourself who know a heck",
    "of a lot more about fitness and health",
    "than i do",
    "but",
    "i was born poor and miserable and uh i'm",
    "now pretty well off and i'm very happy",
    "and i don't and i worked at those and so",
    "i've learned a few things there are some",
    "principles and so i try to lay them out",
    "but in a timeless manner where you can",
    "kind of figure it out yourself because",
    "at the end of the day i can't really",
    "teach anything i can only inspire you",
    "and maybe give you a few hooks so you",
    "can remember things when they happen or",
    "put a name to them so this podcast",
    "actually ended up explaining this tweet",
    "storm so there's a tweet storm with like",
    "36 38 tweets got very famous got",
    "translated to dozens of languages",
    "and these were principles that i came up",
    "with for myself when i was really young",
    "around 13 14",
    "and i've been carrying them in my head",
    "for 30 years and i've been sort of",
    "living them and over time i just",
    "realized like sadly or fortunately the",
    "thing that i got really good at was",
    "looking at businesses and figuring out",
    "the point of maximum leverage to",
    "actually create wealth and capture some",
    "of that",
    "and do it in a very long-term kind of",
    "way not let the you know banker",
    "crash the economy get filled out kind of",
    "way but you know build businesses and",
    "help people and provide value kind of",
    "way",
    "especially when applied to modern",
    "technology and leverage in this age of",
    "infinite leverage that we live in",
    "so the podcast is just explaining each",
    "tweet so these are little three four",
    "five minute snippets",
    "i don't like to say the same thing twice",
    "i don't like to explain in detail",
    "i just i i feel like if you have",
    "something original and interesting to",
    "say you should say it otherwise it's",
    "probably been said better so that",
    "podcast tries to be information dense it",
    "tries to be very concise it tries to be",
    "high impact it tries to be timeless",
    "and it has all the information i think",
    "you need the principles that if you",
    "absorb these and you work hard over 10",
    "years you get what you want",
    "so i've got the one on wealth creation",
    "i'm going to attempt to do one on",
    "happiness is a big word but you know",
    "happiness and inner peace and calm and",
    "all that because what you want is you",
    "don't want to be the guy who succeeds in",
    "life while being high strung high stress",
    "and unhappy and leading the trail of",
    "emotional wreckage with you and your",
    "loved ones which is more common than not",
    "yeah because you got to focus and it's",
    "very hard to be great at everything you",
    "want to be the guy or the gal who gets",
    "there calmly",
    "you know quietly",
    "without struggle",
    "uh you want to be the person who's the",
    "when there's a crisis going on you want",
    "to be the calmest coolest cucumber in",
    "the room who still also figures out the",
    "correct answer um if you can be you were",
    "one of the things that you were saying",
    "is that you feel like happiness is",
    "something that you can learn and then",
    "you can teach yourself to be happy even",
    "just by adopting the mindset that you",
    "are a happy person and proclaiming that",
    "to your friends and so you've sort of",
    "developed a social contract i'm a happy",
    "person and i have to live up to that",
    "yeah i've got hundreds of techniques but",
    "then how did you develop that one",
    "well",
    "there's just a there's social",
    "consistency right humans have a need to",
    "be highly consistent with their past",
    "pronouncements so the way i started my",
    "first tech company was i was in working",
    "inside a larger organization and i told",
    "everybody that i was going to go start a",
    "company i was like i hate this place i'm",
    "going to do my own thing i'm going to be",
    "successful entrepreneur six months past",
    "nine months pass then people start",
    "you're still here i thought you were",
    "going to go start a company",
    "are you lying right that was the",
    "implication so we kind of know this",
    "right social contracts are very powerful",
    "like if you want to give up drinking",
    "right and you're not serious about it",
    "you'll say i'm going to cut back i'm",
    "going to have only one drink a night i'm",
    "going to only drink on weekends you tell",
    "yourself but if you're serious you'll",
    "announce it on facebook you'll tell all",
    "your friends you'll tell your wife",
    "you'll say i'm done drinking i'm",
    "throwing everything out of the house",
    "you'll never see me drink again when you",
    "say that you know you're serious",
    "so i think a lot of these are choices",
    "that we make and happiness is just one",
    "of those choices",
    "and this is unpopular to say because",
    "there are people who are actually",
    "depressed you know chemically or what",
    "have you and there are people who don't",
    "believe that it's possible because then",
    "it creates a responsibility on them it",
    "says oh now if i'm you're saying if i'm",
    "not happy that's my fault",
    "i'm not saying that but i'm saying that",
    "just like fitness can be a choice health",
    "can be a choice nutrition can be a",
    "choice working hard and making money can",
    "be a choice happiness is also a choice",
    "if you're so smart how come you aren't",
    "happy how come you haven't figured that",
    "out that's my challenge to all the",
    "people who think they're so smart and so",
    "capable if you're so smart and capable",
    "why can't you change this",
    "there are a bunch of people though that",
    "actually take pleasure in being",
    "miserable",
    "there's something about the",
    "pursuit of excellence",
    "and of success that supersedes all other",
    "pursuits",
    "that in in their eyes it is",
    "it is that the peak",
    "the pinnacle the most important thing",
    "it's not a trade-off",
    "i would argue that if now when i say",
    "happy happy is one of those words that",
    "means a zillion different things right",
    "it's like love right what does that mean",
    "right i love cheese yeah i'm going to",
    "define it a little bit more tightly",
    "right",
    "so",
    "let's go back to desire right this is",
    "old old buddhist wisdom i'm not saying",
    "anything original but",
    "desire to me is a contract that you make",
    "with yourself to be unhappy until you",
    "get what you want",
    "okay and i keep that in front of mine so",
    "when i'm unhappy about something i look",
    "for what is the underlying desire that i",
    "have that's not being fulfilled it's",
    "okay to have desires you're a biological",
    "creature you're put on this earth you",
    "have to do something you have to have",
    "desires you have a mission but don't",
    "have too many don't pick them up",
    "unconsciously don't pick them up",
    "randomly don't have thousands of them my",
    "coffee is too cold doesn't taste quite",
    "right i'm not sitting perfectly oh i",
    "wish it was warmer uh you know my dog",
    "you know pooped in the lawn i didn't",
    "like that whatever it is pick your one",
    "overwhelming desire it's okay to suffer",
    "over that one but on all the others you",
    "want to let them go so you can be calm",
    "and peaceful and relaxed and then you'll",
    "perform a better job",
    "most people when you're unhappy like a",
    "depressed person",
    "it's not that they have very clear calm",
    "mind they're too busy in their mind",
    "their sense of self is too strong",
    "they're sitting indoors all the time",
    "their minds working working working",
    "they're thinking too much well if you",
    "want to be a high performance athlete",
    "how good of an athlete are you going to",
    "be if you're always having epileptic",
    "seizures if you're always like twitching",
    "and running around and like jumping and",
    "your your limbs are flailing out of",
    "control the same way if you want to be",
    "effective in business you need a clear",
    "calm cool collected mind warren buffett",
    "plays bridge all day long and goes for",
    "walks in the sun he doesn't sit around",
    "like constantly loading his brain with",
    "non-stop information and and getting",
    "worked up about every little thing",
    "we live in an age of infinite leverage",
    "what i mean by that is that your actions",
    "can be multiplied a thousand fold either",
    "by broadcasting at a podcast or by",
    "investing capital or by having people",
    "work for you or by writing code so",
    "because of that the impacts of good",
    "decision making are much higher than",
    "they used to be because now you can",
    "influence thousands or millions of",
    "people through your decisions or your",
    "code",
    "so",
    "a clear mind leads to better judgment",
    "leads to a better outcome so a happy",
    "calm peaceful person will make better",
    "decisions and have better outcomes so if",
    "you want to operate at peak performance",
    "you have to learn how to tame your mind",
    "just like you have to learn how to tame",
    "your body",
    "i love what you're saying warren buffett",
    "might not be the best example because he",
    "drinks like i think six coca-colas a day",
    "and he eats mostly mcdonald's and he's",
    "still alive somehow so that shows you",
    "that low stress is more nobody looks",
    "like [ __ ] like how old is he",
    "i mean he's he's a fairly old man",
    "charlie mungers i think in his 90s right",
    "yeah he's made it really far i wonder",
    "what warren's doing you know i mean just",
    "he's got to know that's bad for him but",
    "it's terrible he doesn't care he doesn't",
    "care i think he's just a little stressed",
    "yeah stresses right so he just enjoys",
    "that coca-cola and that's probably",
    "maybe there is a trade-off right like",
    "maybe him enjoying that junk food and",
    "that coke just ah",
    "that that pleasing of the mind is maybe",
    "better than him just eating",
    "wheatgrass shots and yeah and",
    "salads and just being yeah just super",
    "worked up about everything it's like if",
    "you need your glass of red wine to",
    "de-stress and calm down that's probably",
    "better than you flying off the rails",
    "right right and i think that that's",
    "applicable not just in business but in",
    "probably any pursuit and i like what",
    "you're saying about allow that one thing",
    "to be your obsession",
    "but everything else just you know learn",
    "how to learn how to let things go pick",
    "your battles",
    "and",
    "we like to think that we we like to view",
    "the world as linear which is",
    "i'm going to put in eight hours of work",
    "i'm going to get back eight hours of",
    "output right it doesn't work that way",
    "guy running the corner grocery store is",
    "working just as hard or harder than you",
    "and me how much output is he getting",
    "what you do who you do with how you do",
    "it way more important than how hard you",
    "work right outputs are",
    "non-linear based on the quality of the",
    "work that you put in the right way to",
    "work is like a lion you don't you and i",
    "are not like cows we're not meant to",
    "graze all day right we're meant to hunt",
    "like lions we're closer to carnivores in",
    "our omnivorous development than we are",
    "to herbivores um we don't tell vegans",
    "that yeah sorry",
    "look i wish all that stuff worked i",
    "don't want to eat meat this future",
    "generation will look back at us as worse",
    "than slavers you know because the",
    "holocaust we're committing with the",
    "animals but they'll have artificial",
    "meats that taste and are healthier is uh",
    "better than the real thing so allegedly",
    "allegedly but so as a modern",
    "knowledge worker athlete as an",
    "intellectual athlete you want to",
    "function like an athlete which means you",
    "train hard then you sprint",
    "then you rest then you reassess you get",
    "your feedback loop then you train some",
    "more",
    "then you sprint again then you rest then",
    "you reassess this idea that you're going",
    "to have linear output just by cranking",
    "every day at the same amount of time",
    "same that's",
    "that's machines you know machines should",
    "be working nine to five humans are not",
    "meant work nine of are not meant to work",
    "nine to five no i agree wholeheartedly",
    "but that's it",
    "for people that are",
    "working for someone there's not really",
    "that option",
    "so that's unfortunately the the rub",
    "right that's kind of where my tweet",
    "storm starts which is",
    "first of all the first thing if you're",
    "going to make money is that you're not",
    "going to get rich renting at your time",
    "even lawyers and doctors who are",
    "charging three four 500 an hour they're",
    "not getting rich because their lifestyle",
    "is slowly ramping up along with their",
    "income and they're not saving enough uh",
    "they just don't have that ability to",
    "retire",
    "so the first thing you have to do is you",
    "have to own a piece of a business you",
    "need to have equity either as an owner",
    "an investor shareholder",
    "or a brand that you're building that",
    "accrues to you to gain your financial",
    "freedom",
    "yeah and",
    "i was really fascinated by another thing",
    "that you were bringing up about",
    "working for yourself that you feel in",
    "the future whether it's 50 or 100 years",
    "from now virtually everyone is going to",
    "be working for themselves and i believe",
    "the way you put it is that",
    "the information age is going to reverse",
    "the industrial age yeah if you go back",
    "to hunter-gatherer times how we evolved",
    "we basically work for ourselves we",
    "communicated and cooperated within",
    "tribes but each hunter each gatherer",
    "stood on their own and then combined",
    "their resources with the family unit but",
    "there was no boss hierarchy hierarchy",
    "hierarchy or you're like the third",
    "middle manager down",
    "in the farming age we became a little",
    "bit more hierarchical as we had to run",
    "farms but even those were still mostly",
    "family farms it's industrial work with",
    "factories that sort of created this",
    "model of thousands of people working",
    "together on one thing and having bosses",
    "and schedules and times to show up the",
    "reality is if you have to go i don't",
    "care how rich you are i don't care",
    "whether you're like a top wall street",
    "banker if you have to go if somebody has",
    "to tell you if somebody can tell you",
    "when to be at work and what to wear",
    "and how to behave you're not a free",
    "person you're not actually rich so we're",
    "in this model now where we think it's",
    "all about employment and jobs and",
    "intrinsic in that is that i have to work",
    "for somebody else",
    "but the information age is breaking that",
    "down so ronald kos is an economist who",
    "has this coase theorem a very famous",
    "theorem but it basically just talks",
    "about",
    "why is a company the size that it is why",
    "is a company one person instead of 10",
    "people instead of 100 instead of a",
    "thousand and it has to do with the",
    "internal transaction costs versus the",
    "external transaction costs",
    "let's say i want to do something let's",
    "say i'm building a house and i need",
    "someone to come in and provide the",
    "lumber i'm a developer right do i want",
    "that to be part of my company or do i",
    "want that to be an external provider a",
    "lot of it just depends on how hard it is",
    "to do that transaction with someone",
    "externally versus internally if it's too",
    "hard to keep doing the contract every",
    "time externally i'll bring that in-house",
    "if it's easy to do externally and it's a",
    "one-off kind of thing i'd rather keep it",
    "out of the house",
    "well information technology is making it",
    "easier and easier to do these",
    "transactions externally it's becoming",
    "much easier to communicate with people",
    "gig economy i can send you small amounts",
    "of money i can hire you through an app i",
    "can rate you afterwards so we're seeing",
    "an atomization of the firm we're seeing",
    "the optimal size of the firm shrinking",
    "it's most obvious in silicon valley tons",
    "and tons of startups constantly coming",
    "up and shaving off little pieces of",
    "businesses from large companies and",
    "turning them into huge markets so what",
    "looked like the small little vacation",
    "rental market on craigslist is now",
    "suddenly blown up into airbnb",
    "one example",
    "that's a great example but what i think",
    "we're going to see",
    "is",
    "whether it's 10 20 50 100 years from now",
    "high quality work will be available",
    "we're not talking about driving an uber",
    "we're talking about super high quality",
    "work will be available in a gig fashion",
    "where you'll wake up in the morning your",
    "phone will buzz and you'll have five",
    "different jobs from people who have",
    "worked with you in the past or have been",
    "referred to it's kind of like how",
    "hollywood already works a little bit",
    "with how they're organized for a project",
    "you decide whether to take the project",
    "or not the contract is right there on",
    "the spot you get paid a certain amount",
    "you get rated every day or every week",
    "you get the money delivered and then",
    "when you're done working you turn it off",
    "and you go to tahiti or wherever you",
    "want to spend the next three months and",
    "i think the smart people have already",
    "started figuring out that the internet",
    "enables this and they're starting to",
    "work more and more remotely on their own",
    "schedule on their own time on their own",
    "place with their own friends in their",
    "own way and that's actually how we are",
    "the most productive",
    "so the information revolution by making",
    "it easier to communicate connect and",
    "cooperate is allowing us to go back to",
    "working for ourselves and that is my",
    "ultimate dream even when i run a company",
    "and i have employees i always tell those",
    "people hey i'm going to help you start",
    "your company when you're ready because i",
    "think that's the highest calling maybe",
    "not everybody will get there but",
    "it would be fine if we were even working",
    "a ten person company or twenty person",
    "company is way better than working in a",
    "thousand person company a ten thousand",
    "person company so this idea that we're",
    "all factory like cogs in a machine who",
    "are specialized and have to do things by",
    "rote memorization or instruction it's",
    "going to go away and we're going to go",
    "back to being small groups of creative",
    "bands of individuals setting out to do",
    "missions and when those missions are",
    "done we collect our money we get rated",
    "and then we rest",
    "and reassess until we're ready for the",
    "next sprint has there ever been a study",
    "done on happiness and as it regards the",
    "size of companies",
    "not that i'm aware but to me it's",
    "obvious it's just obvious the smaller",
    "the company the happier you're going to",
    "be the more human your relations are the",
    "less you have rules to operate under the",
    "more flexible the more creative",
    "the more you betray like a human just",
    "because you're able to do multiple",
    "things yeah",
    "um this brings me to",
    "what",
    "is a subject that keeps getting brought",
    "up nowadays is universal basic income",
    "with the oncoming",
    "apocalypse of automation this is how",
    "it's being portrayed by andrew yang",
    "who's running for president i sat down",
    "and talked to him about is very",
    "compelling",
    "and he's a very smart guy and he's an",
    "entrepreneur himself and when he starts",
    "talking about automation and how it's",
    "going to just eliminate massive amounts",
    "of jobs and leave people stranded what",
    "do you when i know you're a guy who",
    "thinks about the future and i'm going to",
    "take this popular point of view on this",
    "i don't i think it's a non-solution to a",
    "non-problem",
    "[Music]",
    "and i mean that in the sense that",
    "automation has been happening since the",
    "dawn of time",
    "electricity came along that put a lot of",
    "people out of work did it right a lot of",
    "people carrying buckets of water and you",
    "know lighting lamps and all those kinds",
    "of things and this was the concern with",
    "factories as well apps everything",
    "literally every single thing that comes",
    "even the printing pros absolutely and",
    "what it does is it frees people up for",
    "new creative work so the question is not",
    "is automation going to eliminate jobs",
    "there is no finite number of jobs we're",
    "not like sitting around dividing up the",
    "same jobs that we're around since the",
    "stone age so obviously new jobs are",
    "being created and they're usually better",
    "jobs more creative jobs so the question",
    "is how quickly is this transition going",
    "to happen and what kinds of jobs will be",
    "eliminated and what kinds of jobs will",
    "be created it's impossible looking",
    "forward to predict what kinds of jobs",
    "will be created if i told you 10 years",
    "ago that podcaster was going to be a job",
    "or that you know playing video games is",
    "going to be a job or commentating on",
    "video games is going to be a job you",
    "would have laughed me out of the room",
    "those are nonsense jobs but yet here we",
    "are so society will always create new",
    "jobs civilization creates new jobs but",
    "it's impossible to predict what those",
    "jobs are so the question is how quickly",
    "is that transition happening",
    "well the reality is even though",
    "everybody keeps talking about this",
    "automation apocalypse we're at a record",
    "low unemployment",
    "explain that where's the transition",
    "donald trump that's hard",
    "all i'm saying is it's it's",
    "i don't see it in the numbers i don't",
    "see it actually happening the question",
    "is how quickly can you retrain people so",
    "it's an education problem the problem",
    "with ubi there's a couple of problems",
    "with ubi one is you're creating a",
    "straight",
    "you're creating a slippery slide",
    "transfer",
    "straight into socialism right the moment",
    "people can start voting themselves money",
    "combined with a democracy right it's",
    "just a matter of time before the bottom",
    "51 votes themselves everything in the",
    "top 49. yeah and",
    "it just it and by the way slippery slope",
    "fallacy is not a fallacy and i know",
    "people like saying that but they haven't",
    "thought it through um but",
    "the moment you start having a direct",
    "transfer mechanism like that in a",
    "democracy you're basically doing it with",
    "capitalism which is the engine of",
    "economic growth you're also forcing the",
    "entrepreneurs out or telling them not to",
    "come here",
    "the estimate i saw for 15k a year",
    "basic income for everybody would be",
    "three quarters of current gdp and of",
    "course gdp would shrink in response as",
    "all the entrepreneurs fled so you would",
    "essentially bankrupt the country",
    "another issue at ubi is that people who",
    "are",
    "down in their luck they're not looking",
    "for handouts it's not just about money",
    "it's also about status it's about",
    "meaning and the moment i start giving",
    "money to you and put you on the dole",
    "i've lowered your status i've made you a",
    "second class citizen so i have to give",
    "you meaning and meaning comes through",
    "education and capability i have you have",
    "to teach a man to fish not to basically",
    "throw your rotting leftover carcasses at",
    "him and say here eat the scraps so it",
    "doesn't solve the meaning problem and",
    "lastly it's nonsense to hand 15k out to",
    "everybody you want to means test people",
    "there's no reason to give it to you and",
    "me so you end up back towards the",
    "welfare system where you do have to",
    "figure out who needs it and who doesn't",
    "so i think the better route is that we",
    "actually establish a set of basic",
    "substance services that you have to have",
    "and we provide those in abundance to",
    "technology-based automation so get basic",
    "housing get basic food get basic",
    "transportation get high-speed internet",
    "access get a phone in your pocket those",
    "are the kinds of things you want to give",
    "people",
    "and finally in terms of the rate of",
    "automation i think we can educate people",
    "very quickly one of the myths that we",
    "have today is that adults can't be",
    "re-educated we view education as this",
    "thing where you go to school you come",
    "out when you're out of college and",
    "you're done no more education well",
    "that's wrong you have all these great",
    "online boot camps and coding schools",
    "coming up they're ones that will even",
    "pay you to go there now",
    "you can educate people and mass and you",
    "can educate them into creative",
    "professions people who are talking about",
    "ai automating programming have never",
    "really written serious code",
    "coding is thinking it's automatic",
    "structure thinking an ai that can",
    "program",
    "as well or better than humans is an ai",
    "that just took over the world that's end",
    "game that's the end of the human species",
    "and i can give you arguments why i don't",
    "think that's coming either",
    "people who are thinking and i know i",
    "take the opposite side from some very",
    "famous people in this debate but we're",
    "nowhere near close to general ai not in",
    "our lifetimes you don't have to worry",
    "about it even in our lifetimes",
    "really it's so overblown uh it's it's",
    "another",
    "it's a combination of cassandra complex",
    "you know it's fun to talk about the end",
    "of the world",
    "combined with a god complex like people",
    "who have lost religion so they're",
    "looking for meaning in some kind of end",
    "of history right right um the reason why",
    "i don't think ai is coming anytime soon",
    "is because a lot of the advances in",
    "so-called ai today are what we call",
    "narrow ai they're really pattern",
    "recognition machine learning to figure",
    "out like what is that object on the",
    "screen or how do you find this signal",
    "and all that noise there's nothing",
    "approaching what we call creative",
    "thinking",
    "to actually model general intelligence",
    "you run into all kinds of problems first",
    "we don't know how the brain works at all",
    "number two we've never even modeled a",
    "paramecium or an amiibo let alone a",
    "human brain number three there's this",
    "assumption that all of the computation",
    "is going at the cellular level at the",
    "neuron level whereas nature is very",
    "parsimonious it uses everything at its",
    "disposal there's a lot of machinery",
    "inside the cell that is doing",
    "calculations that is intelligent that",
    "isn't accounted for and the best",
    "estimates are would take 50 years of",
    "moore's law before we can simulate",
    "what's going on inside a cell near",
    "perfectly and probably 100 years before",
    "we can build a brain that can stimulate",
    "inside the cells so putting it at saying",
    "that i'm just going to model neuron is",
    "on or off and then use that to build a",
    "human brain is overly simplistic",
    "furthermore i would posit there's no",
    "such thing as general intelligence every",
    "intelligence is contextual within the",
    "context of the environment that it's in",
    "so you have to evolve an environment",
    "around it so i think a lot of people who",
    "are peddling general ai the burden of",
    "proof is on them i haven't seen anything",
    "that would lead me to indicate we're",
    "approaching general ai instead we're",
    "solving deterministic closed set finite",
    "problems using large amounts of data but",
    "it's not sexy to talk about that if you",
    "you're talking about mirroring the",
    "actual abilities of cells or are you",
    "talking about recreating the actual",
    "mechanism like what what what is going",
    "on inside",
    "cells and and biological organisms yeah",
    "we just don't know how intelligence",
    "works right we don't know we literally",
    "have no idea so most of the",
    "ai approaches basically say we're going",
    "to try and model",
    "how the brain works but the model at the",
    "neuron level which is saying this",
    "neurons on that neurons often combining",
    "their signal but i'm saying in the",
    "neuron is a cell inside the cell there's",
    "all this machinery going on that's",
    "operating the neuron that is also part",
    "of the intelligence apparatus you can't",
    "just ignore that and abstract that out",
    "you have to model it down to the in",
    "inside the cell level it's also a part",
    "of the biological organism itself",
    "exactly and it has all these needs that",
    "you know the biological organism has to",
    "have food and rest and exactly there's a",
    "balance going on but when you eliminate",
    "all that when there is none of that and",
    "it's just calculations",
    "and we get to a point where it's just",
    "this thing that we've created whether",
    "you call it a computer whether it",
    "doesn't have to be a moving thing even",
    "but a thing that you've created that",
    "stores virtually all the information",
    "that's available in the world stores all",
    "the patterns of all the thinking of all",
    "the great people that have ever lived",
    "all the the writers all the people that",
    "have ever published anything all the",
    "people that have ever spoken any words",
    "stores all of their points all their",
    "counterpoints all their contradictions",
    "applies logic",
    "and reason",
    "and",
    "some sort of sense of the future",
    "and starts improving upon these patterns",
    "and then starts acting on its own based",
    "on the information that it's been",
    "provided with",
    "well first you would have to actually",
    "simulate a structure the human brain",
    "that can hold all that information",
    "you're basically talking about tens of",
    "thousands of brains worth of information",
    "right we can't even build one brain the",
    "next decade or two or three well in",
    "terms of an actual physical brain yes",
    "but what about something that recreates",
    "the abilities of a brain",
    "like i said nature is parsimonious so",
    "we've got this three pound wet wear",
    "object that can hold all this data",
    "nature has been very efficient in",
    "evolving kind of how we get there",
    "i i just don't think computers are",
    "anywhere close to that like they can",
    "hold that amount of data with that",
    "complexity with like the holographic",
    "structure of the brain where it can",
    "recall in many many different ways",
    "and then",
    "i don't think you can evolve a creature",
    "to be intelligent outside of the",
    "boundaries of feedback in a real medium",
    "like if you evolved if you raised a",
    "human being a concrete cell with no",
    "input from the outside they wouldn't",
    "have any feedback from the real world",
    "they wouldn't evolve properly so i think",
    "just dumping information",
    "into into a thing isn't enough it has to",
    "have an environment to operate in to get",
    "feedback from it needs to have context",
    "but isn't that biological i mean what if",
    "you if you have just the all the",
    "information that people have accumulated",
    "and the lessons that people have learned",
    "and you program that into the computer",
    "like if if we can take a computer that",
    "can beat someone at chess the the real",
    "question was well can we make some sort",
    "of an artificial intelligence could beat",
    "someone at go which is far more complex",
    "of chess they figured out how to do that",
    "too and that was a giant shock",
    "right these are still",
    "man-made very closed bounded games",
    "they're they're not they're not on the",
    "road to the unbounded game of life",
    "they are completely artificial but this",
    "didn't go",
    "didn't that give you like a little bit",
    "of a pause a little bit go is not go or",
    "league of legends or fortnite they're",
    "not completely deterministic right",
    "but they're still very artificial very",
    "bounded games being good at go doesn't",
    "mean that you can then suddenly figure",
    "out how to write great poetry right the",
    "creativity for sure is something that's",
    "creativity is the last frontier so i do",
    "believe that automation over a long",
    "enough period of time will replace every",
    "non-creative job or every non-creative",
    "work but that's great news",
    "that means that all of our basic needs",
    "are taken care of and what remains for",
    "us is to be creative which is really",
    "what every human wants",
    "yeah what are you doing right now this",
    "is a creative job sure",
    "um that that brings us back to the idea",
    "of meaning and universal basic income uh",
    "i think the idea of giving someone",
    "15 000 a year",
    "doesn't necessarily",
    "cause whatever what everyone would worry",
    "about is people being on the dole you",
    "would have a bunch of listless people",
    "out there with no meaning in life but",
    "the idea is that fifteen thousand",
    "dollars a year and i'm not necessarily",
    "sure i agree with this i'm not even",
    "endorsing this but that fifteen thousand",
    "dollars a year would just provide you",
    "with the necessities to get by in life",
    "it would give you food it would give you",
    "shelter well it's not gonna stop at 15",
    "because the moment people are like i",
    "mean like 15 like then people would",
    "demand more bernie sanders would be on",
    "this 16 7 45 thousand dollars yeah these",
    "companies are too big yeah that could it",
    "doesn't it doesn't stop it's just it",
    "just goes all the way to bankruptcy the",
    "concern is the slide to socialism",
    "it's obvious yeah i mean heck if i was",
    "on if i was not working and i was",
    "getting my 15 a year i would happily",
    "vote for the guy who would give me 20 or",
    "25 it's just common sense what do you",
    "say to the people that don't believe",
    "that there is such a thing of ethical as",
    "ethical or compassionate capitalism and",
    "there's many people today that are",
    "espousing marxism and they're espousing",
    "some sort of a socialist society where",
    "they believe that capitalism has screwed",
    "people over and",
    "eliminated",
    "the middle class and there are absolute",
    "problems with capitalism i think",
    "monopolies are a problem",
    "i think that uh crony capitalism is a",
    "problem with the government you know",
    "kind of gets in bed with them and sort",
    "of forces things uh i think the bankers",
    "have really you know raped society and",
    "the rest of us are suffering for it yeah",
    "they've essentially taken huge risks",
    "where they privatize the gains and they",
    "socialize the losses so when it fails",
    "they basically get billed out and",
    "bankrupt everybody else",
    "so capitalism has gotten a really bad",
    "name let's talk about its free exchange",
    "free markets",
    "free markets and free exchange are",
    "intrinsic to humans from when the first",
    "person started a fire and somebody came",
    "along with a deer and said hey if i cook",
    "my deer on your fire i'll share some of",
    "it with you right so specialization",
    "labor we trade that's built into the",
    "human species basic math comes from",
    "accounting keeping track of debts and",
    "credits and so on we need to be able to",
    "engage in free trade",
    "the correct criticism of capitalism is",
    "when it does not provide equal",
    "opportunity and so we should always",
    "strive to provide equal opportunity",
    "but people confuse that with equal",
    "outcome when you have equal outcome that",
    "can only be enforced through violence",
    "because different people free people",
    "make different choices and when they",
    "make different choices they have",
    "different outcomes if you don't let them",
    "suffer the consequences of bad choices",
    "or reap the rewards from good choices",
    "then you are forcibly redistributing",
    "through violence it's interesting that",
    "there isn't there are no",
    "socialist working socialist examples",
    "that exist without violence you",
    "basically need someone to show up with a",
    "gun and say okay you're not allowed to",
    "do that you hand this over to that",
    "person so one of the reasons why this",
    "podcast is because i believe everybody",
    "can be wealthy everybody it's not a",
    "zero-sum game it is a positive sum game",
    "you create something brand new you",
    "exchange it with me for something brand",
    "new i've created this higher utility for",
    "both of us the sum of the value created",
    "is positive it's not like status where",
    "it's like you're higher up i'm lowered",
    "down your president so must be vice",
    "president you're a plus one i'm a minus",
    "one and has to cancel a zero",
    "we should all be all for playing",
    "positive",
    "some ethical games the problem is",
    "because of these looters who have ruined",
    "capitalism's name that then you get",
    "socialists coming in and saying burn the",
    "whole system down right you burn the",
    "whole system down we end up like",
    "venezuela or the former soviet union you",
    "know you don't want to be a failed",
    "socialist states with emaciated teens",
    "hunting cats in the streets to eat right",
    "that's literally what happens in some of",
    "these places",
    "so i think it's very important not to",
    "destroy the engine of progress that",
    "brought us here yeah the idea that",
    "socialism just hasn't worked yet",
    "that it needs to the we just need to do",
    "it right if we do it right we can if you",
    "ever 100 million dead and yeah yeah well",
    "let's keep trying all over the world",
    "yeah and and every single time it's been",
    "implemented",
    "have you ever had a conversation with",
    "someone who's a socialist who where many",
    "times some of my better friends are",
    "socialists really we really get into it",
    "yeah and what is there i mean does",
    "anyone have a compelling",
    "perspective at all",
    "i i think",
    "really socialism comes from the heart",
    "right you all we all want to be",
    "socialist",
    "capitalism comes from the head because",
    "they're always cheaters in any system",
    "yes and there's incentives in any system",
    "so",
    "when you're young if you're if you're",
    "not a socialist you have no heart when",
    "you're older if you're not a capitalist",
    "you have no head right you haven't",
    "thought it through so i understand where",
    "it comes from i always liked nassim",
    "taleb's framing on this where he said",
    "with my family i'm a communist with my",
    "close friends i'm a socialist uh you",
    "know at my state level politics i'm a",
    "democrat at you know higher levels i'm a",
    "republican and at the federal level i'm",
    "a libertarian right so basically the",
    "larger the group of people you have",
    "massed together who have different",
    "interests the less trust there is the",
    "more cheating there is the better the",
    "incentives have to be aligned the better",
    "the system has to work the more you go",
    "towards capitalism the smaller the group",
    "you're in you're in a kibbutz you're in",
    "your commune you're in your house you're",
    "in your tribe by all means be a",
    "socialist with my aunts with my brother",
    "with my cousins with my uncles with my",
    "mom with your family i'm a socialist",
    "that's the right way to live a loving",
    "happy",
    "integrated life yes but when you're",
    "dealing with strangers i mean you want",
    "to be a real socialist great open all",
    "your doors and windows tomorrow please",
    "everybody come take what you want see",
    "how that works out yeah",
    "this idea of income inequality that",
    "always strikes me as a very",
    "it's a deceptive term",
    "income inequality well let's flip it",
    "around it comes from outcome",
    "inequality yeah and the outcome",
    "inequality is there because you made",
    "different choices now again going back",
    "if it was because you didn't have the",
    "same opportunities that's a problem yes",
    "so society should always try to give",
    "people equal opportunities so for",
    "example instead of basic income what if",
    "we had a retraining program built into",
    "our basic social fabric which said that",
    "every four years or every six years or",
    "whatever it is maybe it's every 10 you",
    "can take one year out",
    "and we'll pay for you to go retrain",
    "completely and you can go into any",
    "profession you like that has some",
    "earning power and output",
    "hopefully a creative long-term",
    "profession and you can re-educate",
    "yourself",
    "that would be much better for society on",
    "all levels than basically just saying",
    "now you're going to be the dole for the",
    "rest of your life",
    "yeah you just you'd have to",
    "lead that horse to water and then make",
    "them drink it requires people to put in",
    "some effort yeah you know we can't all",
    "just sit around it's just not well",
    "that's my my perspective on income",
    "inequality there's always effort in",
    "equality",
    "and and thought inequality there's just",
    "some people that are obsessed and if",
    "those people become successful it",
    "doesn't mean they stole from you it just",
    "means that they put in the amount of",
    "energy and effort that it's required to",
    "reach where they're at and there's a lot",
    "of virtue signaling that goes on now",
    "where people say well it's because",
    "you're privileged",
    "well you know you know what the greatest",
    "privilege is you're alive 85 of humanity",
    "is dead yeah so how privileged are you",
    "then you're living in the first world",
    "and you're you know you have four limbs",
    "etc so you can take that argument all",
    "the way it's kind of a nonsense",
    "discussion what's a very weird",
    "progressive argument and it as it",
    "pertains to uh race is always a weird",
    "one right because white privilege to me",
    "it although",
    "it you could look at what they're saying",
    "on paper like yes yeah i'm sure",
    "there's more black people that are",
    "harassed by the police i'm sure there's",
    "more black people who are treated",
    "suspiciously by shop owners and the like",
    "but the problem isn't the people who",
    "aren't treated poorly the problem is the",
    "people who treat the people poorly the",
    "problem is racism the problem is not",
    "people that didn't ask to be born white",
    "or whatever they are and they don't get",
    "harassed",
    "so this idea of white privilege or male",
    "privilege or whatever it is that's not",
    "the problem you're just looking at",
    "someone who's not a victim of this",
    "particular problem that you're",
    "highlighting but you're not looking at",
    "the perpetrators of the problem you're",
    "making people perpetrators by simply",
    "existing and having less melanin in",
    "their skin or having their ancestors",
    "come from actually",
    "it's a sneaky way of being racist yeah",
    "and then they say you can't be racist",
    "it's not racist because you're white",
    "that's right that is this hilarious if",
    "you can't be racist against white people",
    "that one that's what there's a variation",
    "of the whole still while i hit you",
    "argument you know stop struggling while",
    "i'm hitting you but it's just so silly",
    "you've just completely changed what",
    "racism means but what's hilarious is",
    "mostly the people who are yelling",
    "racists are not the minorities when i",
    "look on my twitter my social media or on",
    "my news it's white on white violence",
    "virtue signaling yeah it's white on",
    "white violence yeah what's mostly going",
    "on is its elitist whites blue state",
    "whites college educated whites beating",
    "up on high school educated whites blue",
    "collar it's a white collar versus",
    "blue-collar war that's going on and the",
    "rest of us are just kind of watching",
    "like oh that's kind of interesting well",
    "it's also a side effect of the ability",
    "to broadcast right like everyone with a",
    "twitter handle has the ability to",
    "broadcast everyone with a facebook page",
    "has the ability to pontificate and have",
    "these long rambling",
    "these huge statements that people put",
    "out when you you read them it's like how",
    "much time did you put in this what the f",
    "do you put that much time in your kids",
    "or your job or your job or your life or",
    "your future or planning for your you",
    "know how much do you work out a day i",
    "mean are you just these some i read some",
    "people's facebook posts i'm like this is",
    "a preposterous amount of effort that you",
    "put into saying virtually nothing let's",
    "see humans are being creative yeah and",
    "ai do that well that's true it is",
    "creative it's it's creative in a very",
    "odd way right because it's creative and",
    "that they're trying to elicit a response",
    "from people and they're trying to raise",
    "their their social value or raise their",
    "their position on the social totem pole",
    "it's signaling and it's easy signaling",
    "because the kind of thing that everybody",
    "has to agree with you on because nobody",
    "wants to be seen as a horrible person",
    "yeah and it's very hard to make the",
    "nuanced arguments against than it is to",
    "just kind of go along right well it's",
    "also it's some of it is so",
    "cliche that it seems like",
    "i i know one guy who poses as a woman on",
    "on twitter but he does it just obviously",
    "yeah uh what is this the name tatiana",
    "mcgregor",
    "yes yeah yeah",
    "used to be godfrey elwick yes oh is that",
    "the same guy i think so yeah that's",
    "hilarious",
    "i did not they killed his account they",
    "killed his account for 100 sure for",
    "pretending to be transracial that's",
    "right they did yeah",
    "he basically says all the crazy stuff",
    "that people in the left say but he says",
    "the craziest version yes and kind of",
    "just shows how it's okay like",
    "i saw a tweet from recently just said or",
    "her that it's not okay to be white yes",
    "and then some people agree but it's it's",
    "so close to what they say it's so close",
    "that it's like the most artful form of",
    "subtle parody because it's well if you",
    "if you replace in half of these things",
    "if you replace the word white with black",
    "or asian",
    "lynch",
    "yeah yeah it's",
    "it's a strange time in that respect that",
    "there's a favor saying that if you want",
    "to see who rules over you",
    "see who you're not allowed to criticize",
    "excellent yeah that is a that's so true",
    "right yeah that's so true i wonder where",
    "this is going i really do i wonder",
    "because this is it seems like this",
    "newfound ability to broadcast that we",
    "have with",
    "whether you have a youtube page or",
    "whether you have twitter or whatever",
    "you're doing this newfound ability to",
    "spread whatever you're trying to say to",
    "so many people with very little",
    "understanding on the most part from",
    "i think it's actually a great thing",
    "overall yeah now it means that any human",
    "can broadcast any other human on the",
    "planet at any time so for example if you",
    "know a totalitarian dictator were to",
    "come to power and someone was beating up",
    "you know had fascists beating up on old",
    "women like that would get broadcast out",
    "instantly there would be an instant",
    "outrage hue and cry rallying so in that",
    "sense it helps bring attention to the",
    "plight of anybody",
    "but",
    "right now we're going through the phase",
    "where we have this newfound power to",
    "assemble mobs",
    "and people don't know how to deal with",
    "that so it becomes very easy to set up a",
    "mob and have it attack somebody take all",
    "the context out like even this",
    "conversation i'm sure people will take",
    "out snippets put them on social media",
    "and try and get somebody outraged of",
    "course and so you have to learn how",
    "first of all society just has to get",
    "over this idea of outrage like to me",
    "like",
    "outraged people are just people who get",
    "easily outraged are the stupidest people",
    "on social media those are the people i",
    "block instantly uh it's just kind of",
    "very low level thinking right these are",
    "the foots of the these are the foot",
    "soldiers and the mob",
    "eventually society just has to get over",
    "it they have to understand that these",
    "are all snippets being taken out of",
    "context these are doctored video clips",
    "these are just someone who's trying to",
    "get outraged over something",
    "eventually there'll also be anti-mob",
    "tactics like for example",
    "if if i go to someone's twitter feed and",
    "all it is is full of polit political",
    "ranting raving conspiracy theories do i",
    "want to work with this person do i want",
    "to associate with this person do you",
    "want to be friends with this person",
    "their mind is just cluttered with junk",
    "now i don't necessarily blame them i",
    "think that the human brain is not",
    "designed to",
    "absorb all of the world's breaking news",
    "24 7 emergencies injected straight into",
    "your skull with clickbait headline news",
    "if you pay attention to that stuff even",
    "if you're well-meaning even if your",
    "sound of mind and body it will",
    "eventually drive you insane this goes",
    "back to clockwork orange where he's you",
    "know has his eyes opened up he's forced",
    "to watch the news but i think that's",
    "what's happening right now because these",
    "are addictive right",
    "twitter facebook instagram these are",
    "weaponized you have social statisticians",
    "and scientists and researchers and",
    "people in lab coats literally best minds",
    "of our generation figuring out how to",
    "addict you to the news yes and if you",
    "fall for it if you get addicted your",
    "brain will get destroyed and i think",
    "this is the modern struggle right the",
    "modern struggle so the ancient struggle",
    "used to be the tribal struggle you had",
    "your tribe of friends and family you had",
    "your religion you had your country you",
    "had your loyalty you had your",
    "nationality at least you had meaning and",
    "support but now you would struggle",
    "against other tribes",
    "modern life we're so free everything's",
    "become atomized we stand alone you live",
    "in your apartment alone you live in your",
    "house alone your parents don't live",
    "nearby your friends don't live nearby",
    "you don't have any tribal meaning you",
    "don't believe in religion anymore you",
    "don't believe in country anymore it's",
    "fine you got a lot of freedom it's",
    "fantastic but now when they come to",
    "attack you",
    "you're alone and you can't resist so how",
    "do they attack you it's all well-meaning",
    "i don't fault capitalism i love",
    "capitalism but",
    "look at how it happens social media",
    "they've",
    "massaged all the mechanisms to addict",
    "you like a skinner's pigeon or a rat",
    "who's just gonna click click click click",
    "click can't put the phone down the food",
    "they've taken sugar and they've",
    "weaponized it they've put it into all",
    "these different forms and varieties that",
    "you can't resist eating drugs right",
    "they've taken pharmaceuticals and plants",
    "and they've",
    "synthesized them they've grown them in",
    "such a way that you can't you get",
    "addicted you can't put them down porn",
    "right if you're a young male you wander",
    "on the internet it'll like sap away your",
    "libido and you're not going out in real",
    "life society anymore because you've got",
    "this incredibly stimulating stuff coming",
    "at you video games another way to addict",
    "people so you have this you have entire",
    "large factories of people that are",
    "working to addict you to these things",
    "and you stand alone so the modern",
    "struggle as an individual is learning",
    "how to resist these things in the first",
    "place drawing your own boundaries and",
    "there's no one there to help you",
    "that's terrifying",
    "i mean it is a new road that needs to be",
    "navigated by young people that are",
    "there's no map there's no guidebook on",
    "how to handle this our generation is the",
    "transition generation i think our kids",
    "will know how to handle it better",
    "because they'll grow but i hope i hope i",
    "hope too because you're seeing some",
    "ridiculous behavior from people today",
    "that's so common i mean i don't know if",
    "you've been paying attention to this but",
    "there was a guy who",
    "he made a video it turns out it wasn't",
    "even him that made the video at least",
    "that's not what he said but it was a",
    "video where he sort of doctored nancy",
    "pelosi talking and made it look like she",
    "was drunk",
    "and then a bunch of people retweeted it",
    "like oh my god look she's drunk and and",
    "so one of the online publications uh",
    "some website",
    "tracked him down",
    "and doxed him and turned out he's just a",
    "day laborer who is an african-american",
    "trump fan",
    "and thought it would be funny to do that",
    "and it turns out that he didn't even at",
    "least according to him he actually just",
    "put it up on his facebook page what's",
    "even more disturbing is facebook",
    "gave up his information to this website",
    "right",
    "for what",
    "because he made something funny that",
    "made people seem drunk there's a million",
    "of those about me i mean you could find",
    "them i mean i think facebook and twitter",
    "and a bunch of these other social media",
    "platforms are committing slow-motion",
    "suicide through these kinds of",
    "activities",
    "that was a stunning one though that they",
    "would give up this guy who's a laborer",
    "because he made a parody video or he",
    "made someone look foolish with editing",
    "well you now have basically the media",
    "views it as their job to go after",
    "individuals they don't like yeah i use",
    "media with air quotes in that regard so",
    "i don't think this is something that the",
    "new york times would have done",
    "anything responsible but the media is",
    "getting more and more desperate right",
    "because what happened was before the",
    "internet you could have two local",
    "newspapers in every town and you could",
    "have two local",
    "news stations you know tv stations in",
    "every town",
    "and then cnn came along and started",
    "commoditizing the news 24 7 broadcast",
    "and then the internet came along that",
    "was the final nail in the coffin because",
    "what the internet did was it said",
    "actually if there's a fact",
    "that's news you can distribute that",
    "immediately it can go on twitter it can",
    "go on facebook it gets reprinted on",
    "google news a thousand times you know",
    "you're going google news you're like",
    "okay what's the piece of news which",
    "source and three thousand other articles",
    "too many right yeah so news has become",
    "commoditized so the entire news media",
    "has shifted into peddling opinions and",
    "entertainment yes and so now they've",
    "become",
    "a variation between like cheerleaders",
    "shock troops enforcers",
    "you know talking heads so these are now",
    "tribal these are not propaganda machines",
    "signaling for their tribes it's a",
    "right-wing one this left-wing one right",
    "there's the alt-right there's a control",
    "left and the two of them are just",
    "fighting it out using their various",
    "media organs and memes so",
    "basically when you see one of these news",
    "organizations doxing an individual",
    "that's like a tank running over a",
    "soldier",
    "right that's what's going on it's just",
    "war and so there's no there's no such",
    "thing anymore as a neutral media",
    "commentator",
    "the the illusion of objectivity that",
    "journalism had is lost there's no longer",
    "one guy like a walter cronkite that",
    "everyone's going to listen to it's now",
    "all just shock troops fighting wars with",
    "each other",
    "how does this play out",
    "have you thought about it yeah a little",
    "bit uh so what the internet does a lot",
    "of this is internet driven what the",
    "internet does is the internet creates",
    "one giant aggregator or two for",
    "everything one taxi dispatcher one",
    "e-commerce store one search engine one",
    "uh you know",
    "one social media site for friends and",
    "family one for business etc so the",
    "internet is this giant aggregator where",
    "it creates one big hegemon for",
    "everything",
    "and it creates an atomized long tail of",
    "millions and millions of individuals",
    "what it gets rid of is the medium",
    "medium-sized ones in the middle so for",
    "example you might have had like seven",
    "hollywood studios what's all going to be",
    "netflix you had uh you know like",
    "10 large e-commerce players so commerce",
    "players from walmart to",
    "costco to you know kmart and whatever",
    "now it's just going to be amazon and a",
    "ton of small individual brands so that's",
    "the world that we're headed towards one",
    "hegemon and millions of individuals so",
    "where it ends up long term is media will",
    "be a few gigantic outlets you know it",
    "could be the new york times it could be",
    "facebook a few like that and there's",
    "going to be just a really long tale of",
    "millions of independent people so this",
    "idea of who's a journalist and who's not",
    "you know is assange journalist or not",
    "everyone's a journalist that's the world",
    "that we're headed towards i do think the",
    "extreme power the most powerful people",
    "in the world today",
    "and this is not well known but the most",
    "powerful people in the world today are",
    "the people who are writing the",
    "algorithms for twitter and facebook and",
    "instagram because they're controlling",
    "the spread of information they're",
    "literally rewriting people's brains",
    "they're programming the culture and",
    "they're doing it very subtly like google",
    "i believe that you know one of their",
    "execs got up in front of congress and",
    "the congressman asked him uh you know do",
    "you manipulate search results and he",
    "said no we do not manipulate search",
    "results really",
    "that's your job that is literally all",
    "google does google has one job which is",
    "to manipulate search results to pull",
    "them out of the noise and rank them",
    "properly and the out the precise",
    "algorithms of how they do that is very",
    "hidden very complex but influences the",
    "hearts and minds of everybody including",
    "all the voters now if google facebook",
    "and twitter had been smart about this",
    "they would not have picked sides they",
    "would have said we're publishers",
    "whatever goes through our pipes goes",
    "through our pipes if it's illegal we'll",
    "take it down give us a court order",
    "otherwise we don't touch it it's like",
    "the phone company if i call you up and i",
    "say something horrible to you on the",
    "phone the phone company doesn't get in",
    "trouble but the moment this started",
    "taking stuff down that wasn't illegal",
    "because somebody screamed they basically",
    "lost their right to be viewed as a",
    "carrier and now all of a sudden they've",
    "taken on liability so they're sliding",
    "down the slippery slope into ruin",
    "sloping to ruin where the left wants",
    "them to take down the right the right",
    "wants him to take down the left and now",
    "they have no more friends they have no",
    "allies traditionally the",
    "libertarian-leaning republicans and",
    "democrats would have stood up in",
    "principle for the common carriers but",
    "now they won't so my guess is as soon as",
    "congress this is this day is coming if",
    "not already here it might even been here",
    "today actually because this saw",
    "something related",
    "in the news the day is coming when the",
    "politicians realize",
    "that these social media",
    "platforms are picking the next president",
    "the next congressman they're literally",
    "picking and they have the power to pick",
    "so they will be controlled by the",
    "government",
    "in in what way how do you think they're",
    "going to be controlled you think they're",
    "going to have to adhere to strict",
    "principles of freedom of speech no first",
    "particularly unfortunately it's headed",
    "the opposite direction right absolutely",
    "i wish it was freedom of speech much",
    "more likely they're going to be",
    "in the short to medium term they're",
    "going to be hauled in for hearings uh",
    "they're going to be pressured massively",
    "do this don't do that",
    "my concern about that is the the",
    "hearings that i saw with zuckerberg",
    "those people were completely incompetent",
    "they don't seem to understand",
    "they don't but they're just applying",
    "pressure they're just trying to scare",
    "him so he'll do what they want and what",
    "do they want him to do they want him to",
    "basically suppress the other side so if",
    "you're right wing you want to suppress",
    "the left wing if you're left-wing you",
    "want to suppress the right wing and if",
    "you just see where these companies are",
    "headquartered in silicon valley",
    "all the sensors and that's really what",
    "they are there are sensors working",
    "inside these companies they're just",
    "called they're called by different names",
    "obviously right it's double speak you",
    "call it the department defense when it's",
    "the department of war so in this case",
    "the department of safety and trust when",
    "it releases the department of censorship",
    "the sensors are inside silicon valley so",
    "it's going to reflect silicon valley's",
    "politics which is extremely progressive",
    "left ring yeah and if you're not that",
    "you really have no place there's i mean",
    "right try being a conservative an open",
    "conservative at google good luck now you",
    "get lynched yes",
    "that's crazy i mean i don't",
    "think that there was ever",
    "a thing like that",
    "that was so influential and so",
    "politically ideologically one-sided",
    "yeah there's a there's a little saying",
    "on the internet i think it's called",
    "conquest law that any organization",
    "that's not explicitly right-wing",
    "eventually becomes left-wing",
    "and i don't know why that's true but it",
    "does seem to me to be true well it's a",
    "fascinating battle that's going on right",
    "now i mean it really is and",
    "conservatives in as far as social media",
    "is concerned they're just getting",
    "chopped off at the hams left and right",
    "yeah what'll eventually happen is that",
    "whenever you suppress speech",
    "the organism metastasizes then it has to",
    "start turning towards other means if",
    "you're unlucky goes towards violence",
    "if you're lucky they find other outlets",
    "i think what will happen is we will",
    "start creating decentralized media",
    "that's not owned by any single entity",
    "that can't be suppressed or shut down",
    "that will then start spreading these",
    "various things and that will take the",
    "place of twitter or facebook that's",
    "right but it's going to take 10 years 20",
    "years it's not overnight well you know",
    "twitter took 10 years to get to the",
    "point where it's at this mess right now",
    "but it was so interesting to to have",
    "jack dorsey and to to talk to him about",
    "where it's going where he thinks it's",
    "going in his own principles which he",
    "believes that it's a fundamental right",
    "and he believes that freedom of speech",
    "is something that we all should have and",
    "that these",
    "platforms should essentially be",
    "like",
    "like utilities like the electric company",
    "jack is correct and he has the right",
    "vision it's just he's in an organization",
    "where the other individuals in the",
    "organization feel differently very",
    "differently so the organization itself",
    "can get hijacked and his timeline for",
    "changing things it's like",
    "it's decades",
    "i mean i i don't know i shouldn't say",
    "decades but i mean i was like when do",
    "you think that something well there's a",
    "part there was one idea of",
    "having an uncensored twitter like one",
    "twitter that's the wild west like you",
    "could have regular twitter or you could",
    "try wild west twitter like well that",
    "that already exists there's a network",
    "called gab yes but gab isn't even wild",
    "west twitter they when when people dox",
    "people they remove things like that yeah",
    "i mean i think there's certainly lines",
    "around violence and illegality that you",
    "don't want to cross but yes gab is",
    "closer to free speech platform but it's",
    "still not decentralized it can still get",
    "shut down it can still get taken out",
    "it's also suppressed heavily yes so that",
    "so there and the people on there are",
    "right now are extremely right-wing so",
    "it's not a pleasant place for someone",
    "like me to hang out with all the people",
    "that have been kicked off of something",
    "that's right so that's right try going",
    "over there and being moderate try going",
    "over there",
    "there's no room for you yeah",
    "unfortunately because i don't identify",
    "as any party or any creed you know it",
    "doesn't work for me",
    "is that a problem in silicon valley when",
    "you don't identify as anything do you",
    "get pressure it totally it used to be",
    "okay it's not okay anymore when was it",
    "okay like 10 years ago i would say it",
    "was okay and then you started seeing a",
    "shift yeah and now you have to pick",
    "sides otherwise you're automatically the",
    "enemy really yeah struggle sessions and",
    "all that god struggle sessions i'm",
    "exaggerating for effect but but it",
    "definitely has that oppressive feeling",
    "to it right and you also have to be",
    "politically outspoken right yeah it",
    "can't be something that you just stay",
    "neutral about right it's like when uh",
    "tim ferriss i think at some point put",
    "out a tweet about how you can't just say",
    "anything anymore and you know people are",
    "being suppressed and a whole bunch of",
    "people who love them from silicon valley",
    "piled and said what is it that you can't",
    "say what are you afraid to say you can",
    "say whatever you want tim go ahead what",
    "are you afraid of",
    "right they don't like baiting yeah what",
    "was he trying to say wow we have to put",
    "him in that box what is someone who's",
    "thinking about saying something he",
    "shouldn't have said exactly now we know",
    "one great tweet i saw was you know the",
    "left one the culture wars now they're",
    "just driving around shooting the",
    "survivors wow",
    "that's hilarious",
    "yeah i wonder i wonder who as has won",
    "the culture war there's certainly a",
    "battle that's been won in terms of like",
    "control of social media control of",
    "social media is absolutely left well",
    "this is unfortunate",
    "for conservatives but technology is a",
    "force that also pushes left so if you",
    "look all throughout human history like",
    "the left essentially grows and grows and",
    "grows right why is that why is it",
    "inexorably that",
    "as some commentators have said leviathan",
    "slouch is left right leviathan is the",
    "government why does it slouch left and i",
    "think a lot of that has been because of",
    "technology uh technology has made it so",
    "that it makes more like industrial",
    "revolution technology we all band",
    "together we're wards of the state right",
    "contraception is a technology that kind",
    "of helps lean leftward it takes away",
    "from the family unit abortion is a",
    "technology",
    "right it wasn't possible thousands of",
    "years ago",
    "so technology actually empowers the",
    "individual the individual means that you",
    "have the breakdown of family structure",
    "and religion and all that and i'm not",
    "mostly opposed to that but it does mean",
    "that there's a leftward shift to it",
    "now we're getting a small set of",
    "technologies that actually can take you",
    "more rightward encryption is an example",
    "because encryption makes it easier to",
    "have privacy it makes it easier to have",
    "money that is outside of the state",
    "guns 3d printing of guns is an example",
    "of a technology that is more of a",
    "rightward shift",
    "but generally technology leads the world",
    "left",
    "yeah it's it's also",
    "usually highly educated people that are",
    "involved in technology in the first",
    "place and i think",
    "when you look at universities in",
    "particular they tend to lean left in",
    "this country as well",
    "well universities",
    "what happened with the university is",
    "very interesting",
    "universities first when you know became",
    "the arbiters of",
    "data and intellectualism and what's",
    "right and wrong so there's a time period",
    "when it was like should we be doing that",
    "or not well let's look at the university",
    "what do they have to say what are the",
    "smartest people the professors the think",
    "tanks have to say and the universities",
    "got this credibility from the hard",
    "sciences so they got this from uh you",
    "know physics and math and computer",
    "science and chemistry because these",
    "deliver real things the manhattan",
    "project the microprocessor the space",
    "vehicles and so on the electric car",
    "so they gain this mantle of authority",
    "and legitimacy from the hard sciences so",
    "then come the social sciences kind of",
    "sneak in then you get economy",
    "economics and microeconomics is a real",
    "discipline real science real math behind",
    "it logic reason and then you get",
    "macroeconomics which can be politicized",
    "a little bit more voodoo and then you",
    "get social studies and then you get",
    "gender studies and then you get blah",
    "blah blah blah blah blah",
    "and so what happened is that",
    "because we took scientists to be the",
    "high priests",
    "of our new world",
    "science itself has gotten corrupted and",
    "the social sciences and you can tell",
    "they're fake sciences because the word",
    "science tacked on at the end have come",
    "in and hijacked the universities and",
    "become the new think tanks",
    "and so essentially what you see going on",
    "today in the universities is a war",
    "between the social sciences and the",
    "physical sciences and the crossover",
    "point is biology right where you can see",
    "like the whole gender is a social",
    "construct movement is attacking biology",
    "and evolutionary biology",
    "just like in the social sphere they're",
    "coming after the comedians right but you",
    "can see the struggle going on the",
    "universities and i would say the",
    "physical sciences are essentially losing",
    "that war",
    "what can be done",
    "or is it just something that has to play",
    "out is it do we have to realize the",
    "consequences of the foolishness well the",
    "good news is the physical sciences have",
    "a reality on their side",
    "yeah but it's not even i mean",
    "in many ways it's not respected",
    "yeah but you at the end of the day your",
    "aircraft still has to fly",
    "uh you know your microprocessor still",
    "has to compute so there's only so far",
    "they can they can take it uh but i do",
    "see for example in biology a lot of",
    "biologists are facing this difficult",
    "thing where they have to say things that",
    "they know are not true to keep their job",
    "like what well you had brett weinstein",
    "on here",
    "right so that's a that's a clear example",
    "so there's just",
    "the crossover line of what is acceptable",
    "and what's not is entering into biology",
    "and biology will probably suffer the",
    "most",
    "synthetic biology for example",
    "will you know a lot of this will end up",
    "in china",
    "because it won't be",
    "you you won't be able to map facts and",
    "reality",
    "and actions together you won't be able",
    "to get grants you won't be able to get",
    "the adulation of your peers",
    "i don't i don't know enough here so now",
    "i'm in shaky territory but it's just my",
    "sense that that crossover battleground",
    "right now is an evolutionary biology",
    "economics lost well it's certainly in",
    "terms of gender and that that that sort",
    "of that seems to be one of the major",
    "battlegrounds yeah i mean it's also",
    "going to happen for example blank slate",
    "theory you know are we nature are we",
    "nature",
    "um it's kind of uh socially unacceptable",
    "to say that you know a lot of it is",
    "nature and not nurture or vice versa",
    "depending on which side you're on right",
    "those kinds of discussions get corrupted",
    "they do get corrupted and it's really",
    "unfortunate because that's an",
    "unbelievably important thing to",
    "understand like what makes a person a",
    "sociopath what makes a person a super",
    "successful person a winner what what",
    "makes a person a drug addict",
    "what are these factors you can't have a",
    "reasonable conversation about climate",
    "science anymore right it's not a science",
    "it's all politicized you can't even",
    "bring it up everyone's got their minds",
    "made up already well it's what's",
    "uncomfortable to me is people have their",
    "minds made up and they don't even have",
    "the data",
    "well on most of these topics people are",
    "talking past each other anyway they're",
    "talking about different things like when",
    "you get into",
    "uh you know when you when you get into",
    "gun control for example right",
    "one side is talking about the right to",
    "bear arms in case a tyrannical ruler or",
    "king tries to take over the country the",
    "other time the other side is talking",
    "about school shootings and you know",
    "protecting people in their homes right",
    "from crime so they're just talking about",
    "two different things right and it's just",
    "not politically acceptable to even talk",
    "about the same thing or when it gets to",
    "immigration the right is talking about",
    "uh you know",
    "the left is like bundling together",
    "illegal immigration and legal",
    "immigration into one thing yes right",
    "whereas in the on the right sometimes",
    "you've got racist hiding in there so it",
    "doesn't help their cause right they're",
    "talking about two different things yeah",
    "if they were talking about the same",
    "thing which is how many immigrants",
    "should we let into the country and you",
    "know what are the criteria for that that",
    "would be a very different conversation",
    "than no immigrants or everybody comes in",
    "and then also on the left you know you",
    "have this benefit that everybody who's",
    "currently coming in illegally is going",
    "to vote for the left because of where",
    "they're coming from in their",
    "socioeconomic circumstances",
    "to me the test of any good system is you",
    "build a system hand it over to your",
    "enemies to run for the next decade so",
    "for example if you want a censorship on",
    "twitter or facebook you should build",
    "that system and then hand it over to the",
    "other side to run so if you're a",
    "left-winger who's promoting uh",
    "censorship let somebody else running",
    "same with immigration if you want",
    "immigration system build the system then",
    "hand it over to the other side to run it",
    "that's how you know it's a good system",
    "there's no room for nuance when you're",
    "dealing with these political",
    "battlegrounds when when you're dealing",
    "with right versus left and one side has",
    "a clearly established",
    "stance that you're supposed to take",
    "like gun control is a great example of",
    "that right there's no room for",
    "what about mental health what about the",
    "fact that so many of these people are on",
    "psych medications right",
    "why is that not being discussed we're",
    "running one of the greatest uh",
    "mental health experiments in history",
    "when we're doping everybody up and ssris",
    "yeah and you know maybe if you give 30",
    "million people sris maybe like 29.9",
    "million are a lot happier and then you",
    "have a fraction that commits suicide or",
    "detonate yeah you're basically trading",
    "the mean for the variance right you have",
    "blow up risk",
    "yeah there's no room for nuance which is",
    "why i stay out of politics largely do",
    "they drag you in though sometimes they",
    "always try i mean these conversations in",
    "this conversation you get to get dragged",
    "in sure but i'm sure there's going to be",
    "some people here here's the thing about",
    "politics because they're we we have a",
    "first-past-the-post system what that",
    "means is that whoever wins 51 of the",
    "vote in this country gets a lot of the",
    "power right it's not like proportional",
    "representation where the greens have ten",
    "percent and you know libertarians are",
    "three percent or whatever it's just like",
    "you're all democrat in power now we're",
    "all republican because of that to win",
    "you have to pick one of these two sides",
    "right you have you have to choose you",
    "can't just you can't just",
    "you can't just basically say i'm gonna",
    "be",
    "uh you know nuanced about it you you",
    "can't vote for a third party that's",
    "throwing over your vote right i have a",
    "friend who's trying to fix that he's",
    "starting this thing called a good party",
    "where like you kick-start your vote so",
    "you combine all your votes you hold them",
    "in reserve and then when you have enough",
    "to win then you vote that person in",
    "power right you don't you don't throw",
    "away your vote but outside of those",
    "hacks we're never gonna get a third",
    "party elected so because of that all of",
    "your beliefs have to neatly fit into the",
    "democrat bundle or the republican bundle",
    "and so when you get into that tribe uh",
    "if you signal outside of that out of",
    "that bundle you get attacked yeah so",
    "it's literally it's making you into an",
    "unclear thinker it's making you into a",
    "muddled thinker if all of your beliefs",
    "line up into one political party you're",
    "not a clear thinker if all your beliefs",
    "are the same as your neighbors and your",
    "friends you're not a clear thinker",
    "you're literally just your beliefs are",
    "socialized they're taken from other",
    "people so if you want to be a clear",
    "thinker you cannot pay attention to",
    "politics it will destroy your ability to",
    "think",
    "what dread",
    "most of modern life all our diseases are",
    "diseases of abundance not diseases of",
    "scarcity right old times i may have",
    "starved",
    "you know old times if i got sugar that",
    "was a wonderful thing i should have",
    "eaten all the sugar to get my hands on",
    "if i gotten a piece of news or gossip",
    "that was interesting data that would",
    "have helped my life and moved me forward",
    "if i'd gotten some brief amount of",
    "entertainment whether through video",
    "games or magazines or whatever that",
    "would have been good",
    "now it's all disease of abundance we are",
    "overexposed to everything so the way to",
    "survive in modern society is to be an",
    "ascetic it is to retreat from society",
    "there's too much society everywhere you",
    "go society in your phone society in your",
    "pocket society in your ears you're being",
    "socialized right now by listening to",
    "this podcast right we're socializing you",
    "we're programming you everyone's trying",
    "to program everybody the only solution",
    "is turn it off",
    "the only solution is to turn it off and",
    "concentrate on your breathing",
    "meditation yeah yes i mean it works it's",
    "it's been a lifesaver for me oh i do it",
    "and i i do it whenever i get like spare",
    "time i was in the doctor's office this",
    "morning and uh i knew it was going to be",
    "20 minutes so i just sat there with my",
    "eyes closed for 20 minutes and i",
    "meditated you know when i was growing up",
    "there was this statement i think it was",
    "pascal he said you know all of man's",
    "problems arise because he cannot sit by",
    "himself in a room for 30 minutes alone",
    "and it's very true i always needed to be",
    "stimulated and when the iphone came",
    "along boredom was dead i would never be",
    "bored again even if i'm standing in line",
    "i'm on my iphone and i thought it was",
    "great and when i was a kid i used to try",
    "and overclock my brain be like how many",
    "thoughts can i think at once the answer",
    "is only one but i would try to like",
    "think multiple thoughts at once and i",
    "was proud of that i was proud that my",
    "brain was always running this engine was",
    "always moving",
    "and it's a disease it's actually the",
    "road to misery and now that i'm older i",
    "realize like",
    "you actually want to again rest your",
    "mind you want to learn how to settle",
    "into your mind now i look forward to",
    "solitary confinement you leave me alone",
    "for a day it'll be like the happiest day",
    "i've had in a while",
    "and and that is a superpower that i",
    "think everybody can attain",
    "the superpower of learning to be alone",
    "and enjoying it yeah",
    "yeah",
    "well i think it's critical and i and i",
    "do think that this these times where you",
    "just think about things just be alone",
    "and think about things are so rare these",
    "days",
    "and i think",
    "during those rare times is when you",
    "really get to understand what you",
    "actually believe or don't believe",
    "yeah it's it's funny when i first",
    "started meditating it was really hard",
    "right because everybody i think a lot of",
    "people who listen to this broadcast",
    "they've heard of meditation that has a",
    "good rep so everybody tries it they",
    "struggle",
    "they kind of give it up it's one of",
    "those things that everybody says they do",
    "but nobody actually does right it's like",
    "not eating sugar right everyone talks",
    "about how yeah i don't eat sugar but",
    "like yeah then right then the dessert",
    "tray rolls around and everyone's going",
    "for the cookies yeah right",
    "so it's become one of those things and",
    "in fact it's not even become a signaling",
    "thing where it's like oh how much did",
    "you meditate i meditated this much or",
    "you know there are people now wearing",
    "headbands saying with tweety birds a",
    "chirp and then when they're in deep",
    "meditation i don't i don't know how they",
    "make it work but they'll be like i got a",
    "lot of trips today how many trips did",
    "you get oh my god oh your meditation",
    "technique is wrong mine is right but",
    "really all it is is the art of doing",
    "nothing okay and it's important because",
    "i think when we",
    "when we grow up right it's all this",
    "stuff happening to you in your life and",
    "some of it you're processing some of it",
    "you're absorbing and some of it you",
    "should probably think a little bit more",
    "about and work through but you don't you",
    "don't have time so it gets buried in you",
    "and it's all these preferences and",
    "judgments and unresolved situations and",
    "issues and it's like your email inbox",
    "it's just piling up email after email",
    "after email that's not answered going",
    "back 10 20 30 40 years",
    "and then when you sit down to meditate",
    "those emails start coming back at you",
    "hey what about this issue what about",
    "that issue have you solved this did you",
    "think about that your regrets there you",
    "have issues there",
    "and that gets scary people don't want to",
    "do that it's like it's not working i",
    "can't clear my mind i better get up and",
    "not do this but really what's happening",
    "is it's it's self therapy it's just that",
    "instead of paying a therapist to sit",
    "there and listen to you you're listening",
    "to yourself and you just have to sit",
    "there as those emails go through one by",
    "one you work through each of them until",
    "you get to the magical inbox zero and",
    "there comes a day when you sit down you",
    "realize the only things you're thinking",
    "about are things that happened yesterday",
    "because you've processed everything else",
    "not necessarily even resolved it but at",
    "least listen to yourself",
    "and that's when meditation starts and i",
    "think it's a it's a very powerful thing",
    "that everybody should experience and",
    "that's when you arrive upon the art of",
    "doing nothing well i think it's even a",
    "problem that most people are getting",
    "their meditation from an app",
    "i will not use an app it's sneaky i mean",
    "sam harris is a very good meditation app",
    "i should say that but you should be able",
    "to just do it and many people can it is",
    "literally the art of doing nothing yeah",
    "all you need to do for meditation is",
    "just sit down close your eyes",
    "comfortable position whatever happens",
    "happens if you think you think if you",
    "don't think you don't think don't put",
    "effort into it don't put effort against",
    "it it's all you need do you concentrate",
    "on your breath or do you have a specific",
    "technique nothing nothing no you just",
    "sit you just sit i think about my breath",
    "that's all i do i just need to try to",
    "only concentrate on breathing i used to",
    "do that but at some level all the",
    "concentration every meditation technique",
    "is leading you to the same thing which",
    "is just witnessing yes and concentration",
    "is a technique to still your mind enough",
    "that you can then drop the object of",
    "concentration",
    "so you could also just try going",
    "straight to the end game the problem",
    "with what i'm talking about which is not",
    "focusing on your breath is you will have",
    "to listen to your mind for a long time",
    "it's not going to work unless you do at",
    "least an hour a day and preferably at",
    "least 60 days before you kind of work",
    "through a lot of issues so it'll be held",
    "for a while but when you come out the",
    "other side it's great you get rid of the",
    "chatter",
    "or when the chatter comes it's in the",
    "background it's dimmer it's smaller",
    "you've heard it before you see the",
    "patterns",
    "it's more recent it's something you need",
    "to resolve anyway",
    "and you will get moments of actual",
    "silence what is your",
    "what's your ultimate state when you",
    "meditate like is there a state where",
    "you've achieved",
    "rarely if ever",
    "where you just",
    "you you're in bliss or you're in harmony",
    "or you're in enlightenment like what",
    "it's kind of it's kind of indescribable",
    "uh because when you're really meditating",
    "you're not there when there's no",
    "thoughts there's no experience there's",
    "nothing there's just",
    "nothing uh so it's it's hard to describe",
    "but i would say that uh it's like a",
    "you can definitely",
    "every psychedelic state that people",
    "encounter using so-called plant",
    "medicines can be arrived just through",
    "pure meditation and i've definitely hit",
    "some of those states you've hit some",
    "transcendent psychedelic states where",
    "you're vaccinating the whole deal i've",
    "had trippy visuals i've had the kind of",
    "the lights and colors i've had the",
    "so-called downloads i've had the",
    "realizations i've had the bliss i've had",
    "the light i've had the colors but not",
    "every time no it's really and in fact i",
    "would say that that's a that's also like",
    "an experience that you can start craving",
    "which will then actually take you out of",
    "meditation",
    "um where you really and i'm not",
    "enlightened or anything close to it so",
    "not even the ballpark but my own",
    "experience and this is this personal",
    "experience is",
    "the place where i end up the most that",
    "is really the one that i i want to be at",
    "is peace",
    "it's just peace peace happy",
    "yeah peace to me peace is happiness at",
    "rest and happiness is kind of peace and",
    "motion you can convert peace to",
    "happiness anytime you want but peace is",
    "what you want most of the time that's",
    "interesting you can convert peace to",
    "happiness anytime you want yeah if",
    "you're a peaceful person anything you do",
    "will be a happy activity",
    "and by the way being on social media",
    "engaging politics will not bring you",
    "peace there is nothing less peaceful",
    "right and",
    "today's day and age the way we think you",
    "get peace is by resolving all your",
    "external problems but there's unlimited",
    "external problems so the only way to",
    "actually get pieces on the inside by",
    "giving up this idea of problems who",
    "thinks you can get peace by resolving",
    "external problems other than politicians",
    "everybody that's what everybody's",
    "struggling to do right why are you",
    "trying to make money to solve all your",
    "money problems",
    "why are you trying to win a politics",
    "because then you'll be at peace because",
    "your people will have one",
    "it's a daunting task to get your [ __ ]",
    "together it's easier to change yourself",
    "than to change the world",
    "that's true yeah and the best way to",
    "change the world is to change yourself",
    "exactly it's all yeah it's",
    "all these people who are shouting on",
    "social media the best way is just to",
    "actually live the life that you want",
    "other people to live",
    "like i went down to new zealand and",
    "there's this guy",
    "that i met with and",
    "you know everyone's on social media",
    "shouting about environmentalism and",
    "conservative and sustain and i go to",
    "this guy's house and he was doing a",
    "very quietly very gently he was doing a",
    "two week long",
    "zero waste experiment",
    "where he was throwing out nothing so",
    "every package that he opened he would",
    "keep and he would like clean it up so he",
    "would keep his amazon boxes it would",
    "keep the little containers even a tea",
    "bag if you open the tea bag he has to",
    "figure out how to compost the tea inside",
    "how to make the tea itself useful how to",
    "make the tea bag like a little storage",
    "item so there was no trash he was",
    "literally living with zero",
    "trash waste and he was doing it and it",
    "was really inspirational meeting people",
    "like him made me far more",
    "environmentally conscious than you know",
    "any amount of people yelling at me on",
    "social media ever will how long did he",
    "do that for i think it was two weeks it",
    "was hard",
    "what the [ __ ] are you gonna do with tea",
    "bags",
    "he had quite the collection",
    "he was filling them with little things",
    "he sounds like a crazy this hoarder like",
    "a hoarder person with stacks of tea bags",
    "in his house a very impressive guy yeah",
    "that's a strange way to go about things",
    "i i appreciate that i mean",
    "look it is entirely possible to somehow",
    "or another engineer all of our cups and",
    "all of our things and all our about to",
    "be biodegradable",
    "you know the struggle with the modern",
    "environmental movement is that they",
    "identify the correct problem which is",
    "finite earth spaceship earth this is all",
    "they got don't ruin it but they don't",
    "have the solution so what they say is no",
    "growth no growth no growth well the",
    "problem is you got three billion indian",
    "and chinese who aren't going to stay in",
    "poverty they're going to grow whether",
    "you like it or not so you can yell at",
    "them you can scream at them you can yell",
    "at us and scream at us but that's not",
    "going to happen so the only way out",
    "unfortunately is again through",
    "technology which is you have to build",
    "green technology and i give musk a lot",
    "of credit you know for being one of the",
    "few people who's out there trying to do",
    "that so you build things that are",
    "biodegradable and good for you and",
    "healthier and everybody wants to be",
    "healthier chinese want to be healthier",
    "indians want to be healthier they want",
    "to be cleaner if you say i can clean up",
    "your rivers i can clean up your forests",
    "i can have your children not get sick",
    "with cholera and diphtheria and typhoid",
    "i can cure your diseases i can help make",
    "your immune system stronger i can give",
    "you clean drinking water like that is",
    "what causes people to become",
    "environmentalists not shouting and",
    "screaming at them that they shouldn't",
    "grow and they should stop pumping things",
    "into the sky and you know they have no",
    "concept of that they're just trying to",
    "get out of poverty so i think the modern",
    "environmental movement",
    "identifies the correct problem but then",
    "doesn't come up with the right set of",
    "solutions that are appealing to people",
    "people are not going to give up economic",
    "growth they're going to have to get rich",
    "first hmm that's yeah that's a very good",
    "point but how do you do how do you do",
    "both",
    "you lower the price of clean",
    "technologies massively so you basically",
    "make clean technologies cost competitive",
    "through subsidy technologies",
    "innovation",
    "ideally you can subsidize in the short",
    "to medium term until the innovation",
    "curve is is crossed i mean like tesla",
    "doesn't have any patents right right or",
    "they they freely give away their patents",
    "that's the example of how you can do it",
    "um so you know someone in if you want to",
    "get rid of plastic such straws",
    "yeah you can do it here and there you",
    "can get san francisco to ban plastic",
    "straws but china's not going to blend",
    "ban plastic straws not until you build a",
    "paper straw that is you know same cost",
    "good durability and then you in and then",
    "you educate the chinese like hey this is",
    "petroleum you know this plastic that",
    "you're doing is petroleum this is bad",
    "for you here's the chemical composition",
    "here's the things that are going in your",
    "bloodstream and they want healthy happy",
    "kids also so they're going to have their",
    "kids use paper straws maybe straws",
    "aren't the best example but you can you",
    "know this is true with fossil fuels for",
    "example that's that's probably the best",
    "one or replacing a lot of plastics with",
    "glass and paper and so on",
    "yeah there's a new technology that was",
    "just rhonda patrick had it on her",
    "twitter today about",
    "they're able to convert",
    "plastic uh waste into fuel",
    "and that there's companies that are",
    "actively trying to do that now so then",
    "in that way plastic waste will become",
    "valuable right and it'll become a",
    "commodity it'll become something that",
    "people are resource now there's certain",
    "problems this doesn't solve this doesn't",
    "solve carbon this doesn't solve",
    "deforestation uh you know so there you",
    "kind of have to step in with other means",
    "so for example you look at the amazon",
    "right everyone's complaining about the",
    "amazon being deforested well you're not",
    "the poor brazilian farmer right so",
    "you're you're sitting here in your",
    "comfortable chair like social media",
    "hammering away at you know the evil",
    "brazilians for deforesting the amazon",
    "but the amazon has incredible resources",
    "if we really care about it we should",
    "turn it into an incredible tourist park",
    "and put your money where your mouth is",
    "start doing ecotourism in the amazon",
    "start paying for it and then maybe take",
    "the future rights for all the",
    "pharmaceuticals that are going to come",
    "out of all the incredible plants there",
    "and start selling those off so that",
    "people so that maybe give the",
    "pharmaceutical companies an incentive to",
    "preserve the biodiversity of the amazon",
    "say hey if you buy this patch of the",
    "amazon you conserve it and you can serve",
    "it whatever plant medicines that come",
    "out of there that you can then license",
    "you get the patent for 20 years or 30",
    "years or whatever",
    "so i think there are solutions where we",
    "as the first worlders who have money can",
    "put our",
    "money where where our mouth is and go",
    "and rescue these kinds of properties",
    "that's a very interesting solution but i",
    "could see immediate pushback from people",
    "that don't think the pharmaceutical",
    "company should have the rights to this",
    "natural plan okay or the or the",
    "government does it and then the",
    "government gets the patents and the",
    "government will auction off the patents",
    "later or they'll worse or they'll",
    "license them or whatever it is right",
    "well that's often like just this",
    "the often the problem is there is no",
    "really good solution there's a bunch of",
    "solutions that also have drawbacks",
    "that's life yeah right that's the",
    "trade-off so it's being human very messy",
    "yeah it's a constrained environment",
    "obviously i skew more towards a private",
    "property capitalist type solutions",
    "because even though they're not perfect",
    "they have been proven to actually work",
    "right once something is your property",
    "you take care of it right you're not",
    "gonna you're not gonna crap all over",
    "your own house",
    "um but it should probably be temporary",
    "property not permanent property you see",
    "a lot of countries around the world not",
    "doing this no foreign ownership of land",
    "thing for example or mexico has no",
    "private ownership of beaches right so",
    "you can draw the line at certain points",
    "yeah do you enjoy doing this kind of",
    "thing where you break things down and",
    "give your perspective on things and try",
    "to illuminate certain complex subjects",
    "i'm not trying to illuminate so much as",
    "you know talking to you i learn as much",
    "as i",
    "say and i learn it for myself because",
    "i'm being forced to articulate it right",
    "i can sit around and think my thoughts",
    "all day long but it's a lot of it's",
    "going to be nonsense it's not i'm going",
    "to because there are gaps in thinking",
    "where you make leaps",
    "because you're kind to yourself that you",
    "don't realize you're making but when",
    "you're forced to write it down and this",
    "is why i tweet or when you have to talk",
    "to somebody you have to complete those",
    "gaps and make it a proper logical chain",
    "and the mistake that i made when i was",
    "young was you know i always wanted to",
    "seem like the smartest kid in the room",
    "uh you know like just like you probably",
    "want to seem like the funniest kid in",
    "the room or the toughest kid in the room",
    "right we're all losers starting out we",
    "want to be winners so we pick the thing",
    "we're good at and we double down on it",
    "so i always want to be the smartest kid",
    "in the room so what did i do i read a",
    "lot of books i memorized a lot of things",
    "and then whatever i hadn't memorized is",
    "pre-google i made it up so it sounded",
    "good okay",
    "pre-google after google fact checking",
    "started and i had to get better right so",
    "google improved me that way a lot of",
    "people exactly so",
    "now what i realize is that the biggest",
    "mistake with memorization",
    "right because when you're actually",
    "trying to live your life in congress",
    "with reality",
    "you",
    "you want to have a deep understanding of",
    "what you do and why you do it and so",
    "it's much more important to know the",
    "basics really well then is to know the",
    "advanced knowing calculus wouldn't help",
    "you today it doesn't help you in",
    "business doesn't help you in most things",
    "but knowing arithmetic really will help",
    "you really",
    "whether it's at the corner grocery store",
    "counting change to figuring out the",
    "value of your podcast business to",
    "figuring out how to do the probability",
    "math on you know some action that you",
    "want to take so understanding basic",
    "mathematics cold is way more important",
    "than memorizing calculus concepts and",
    "the problem is and this is true of i",
    "think all reasoning it's much better to",
    "know the basics from the ground up solid",
    "foundation of understanding a steel",
    "frame of understanding than it is to",
    "just have a scaffolding we're just",
    "memorizing advanced concepts this is why",
    "there are a lot of people i'm sure that",
    "you listen to who are really smart they",
    "use a lot of jargon and you can't quite",
    "follow their reasoning you don't know",
    "how they're putting things together and",
    "you this deep down suspicion they don't",
    "even really understand right",
    "so if you look at the the most powerful",
    "thinkers especially the ones where money",
    "or life is on the line",
    "they have to understand the basics",
    "really really well richard feynman the",
    "physicist was able to",
    "he had this piece in one of his lectures",
    "where he takes you from counting numbers",
    "on your hand all the way to calculus in",
    "four pages of text orally but written",
    "down is four pages of text and it's a",
    "complete unbroken logical chain that",
    "takes you through geometry trigonometry",
    "precalculus analytic geometry graphs",
    "everything all the way to calculus he",
    "understood numbers at a core level he",
    "didn't have to memorize anything when",
    "you're memorizing it's an indication",
    "that you don't understand",
    "you should be able to rederive anything",
    "on the spot",
    "and if you can't you don't know it",
    "so do you apply that to",
    "things other than mathematics everything",
    "everything you don't even make attempt",
    "to memorize things just make an attempt",
    "to understand them you can't help but",
    "memorize things but if you can't and",
    "this is where twitter is great for me is",
    "i try to understand something and then i",
    "try to write it down in such a way that",
    "i can remember it just the basic hook",
    "that'll point towards the deeper",
    "understanding and i'm forced to explain",
    "it to people and that's how i know i",
    "understand something so this is what i",
    "meant originally we talked about reading",
    "a good book i'll read one page in a",
    "night and then i spend the rest of night",
    "thinking about it or i'm chasing down",
    "references on wikipedia or weird blog",
    "posts trying to understand it",
    "you know so for example",
    "there was a",
    "i was dealing with this is a few months",
    "back i was dealing with a question of",
    "stupid topic but the meaning of life",
    "right what's the meaning how could that",
    "be stupid though well it's just trite",
    "it's right you're not supposed to think",
    "about it it's something you ask your",
    "parents when you're young they tell you",
    "don't worry about it or they'll get a",
    "job yeah exactly good job you freaking",
    "hippy or here's god god is the meaning",
    "of life right and so i was just trying",
    "to resolve for myself like",
    "what could the answer be right not what",
    "is the answer but what could the answer",
    "be",
    "and so at a core level i was forced to",
    "kind of hunt down all these weird little",
    "things and really understand for myself",
    "and it's got to be personal right but i",
    "have to establish for myself what it",
    "could and could not be",
    "and that gave me some level of peace",
    "so now i have to keep asking that",
    "question what is the meaning of life",
    "i mean you you sh i think the question",
    "is more interesting than the answer",
    "everyone should explore this on their",
    "own but let me just explore a few parts",
    "with you right",
    "so first is if i gave you an answer if i",
    "said the meaning of life has to please",
    "god well which god okay judeo-christian",
    "god well okay why that one why this",
    "thing the problem is it's a why question",
    "you can keep asking why forever right",
    "any answer i give you you'll just ask",
    "why again why again",
    "that's right and you end up in a place",
    "called agrippa's trilemma okay this is a",
    "philosophical exercise but i i kind of",
    "thought it through then googled around",
    "and there's a thing called agrippa's",
    "trilemma",
    "and agrippa's trauma says that any",
    "questioning like this",
    "y will always end in one of three places",
    "okay first is infinite regress",
    "right why because of this why that what",
    "and just keep going forever the second",
    "is circular reasoning well a why a",
    "because of b or why b because of a right",
    "you get trapped in that or the third is",
    "an axiom and the most popular axiom is",
    "god but it could be anything because of",
    "math because of science because the big",
    "bang because the simulation right these",
    "are all axioms these are all just",
    "stopping points",
    "saying simulation we're in a simulation",
    "or saying it's the big bang is just",
    "another way of saying god it's just",
    "god's a dirty word so we don't use it as",
    "much anymore but same thing so you end",
    "up in one of these three dead ends",
    "essentially right so there is no answer",
    "uh the real answer is because",
    "right what is the meaning of life yeah",
    "you get to make up your own answers the",
    "beauty if there was a single answer we",
    "would not be free we would be trapped",
    "because then we would all have to live",
    "to that answer then we'd be bored like",
    "robots each one competing with each",
    "other to fulfill that single meaning",
    "more than the others back to signaling",
    "like i'm better at it than you are but",
    "luckily there is no answer so you just",
    "do whatever you want",
    "the meaning of life",
    "it's funny that",
    "that what that's the basis of all",
    "existential angst that you don't",
    "you don't know why you're here and you",
    "have this feeling that it could be",
    "meaningless",
    "it is i mean if you",
    "when you start pondering the",
    "the multiverse the universe the galaxies",
    "the solar system the planet the organism",
    "the cells inside the organism the",
    "bacteria the parasites right the",
    "symbiotic relationship we have to our",
    "environment and you start going jesus",
    "christ what am i just a little piece of",
    "this thing it's like well the answers to",
    "all the great questions or paradoxes",
    "yeah so for example you're asking like",
    "do i matter that's like really the",
    "question you asked right well how do i",
    "matter in this infinite universe well",
    "you know on the one hand you're separate",
    "no two points are the same every point",
    "is every two points are infinitely",
    "different you're completely separated no",
    "one will have your thoughts your",
    "emotions your feelings your experience",
    "so your life is a single player game",
    "you're trapped inside your head and",
    "you're just aware of a bunch of things",
    "going on and that's it",
    "on the other hand",
    "i cannot say the word joe rogan without",
    "invoking the entire universe joe alien",
    "comes along says what's that joe rogan",
    "what's joe rogan's a human what's a",
    "human bipedal ape what's an ape on the",
    "earth what's the earth planet what's a",
    "planet solar system where was the carbon",
    "made inside stars right instead i have",
    "to create the entire universe",
    "to just say the words joe rogan so in",
    "that sense you're connected to",
    "everything it's inseparable so",
    "the answer to that question of do i",
    "matter is i am nothing and i am",
    "everything and you'll find this with all",
    "the great questions the answers are all",
    "paradoxes which is why at some level",
    "it's sort of pointless to pursue them to",
    "find a trite answer like i'm giving but",
    "the act of pursuing them is actually",
    "really useful because then it gives you",
    "certain intrinsic understanding in your",
    "life that brings a level of peace",
    "i feel like there's with many people",
    "this",
    "stress of this question is also",
    "accentuated by unhappy lives it's",
    "actually accentuated by unhappy choices",
    "by being trapped there's a big",
    "difference between not knowing what the",
    "meaning of life is and",
    "god i gotta get the [ __ ] out of this job",
    "i have to i can't live my life this way",
    "what's the meaning of life if this is my",
    "life which is why i always start with",
    "let's get you rich first",
    "right that's why i'm very practical",
    "about it because look the you know",
    "buddha was a prince okay he started out",
    "really rich and then he got to go off in",
    "the woods",
    "and in the old days what happened was if",
    "you wanted to be peaceful inside you",
    "would become a monk you would renounce",
    "everything you would become an ascetic",
    "you would give everything up you",
    "renounce women men you'd renounce",
    "children you'd announce money you'd",
    "renounce politics science technology",
    "everything and you would go out in the",
    "woods by yourself you could give",
    "everything up to be free inside",
    "well today we have this wonderful",
    "invention called money where you can",
    "just store stuff up in a bank account",
    "okay and you can basically",
    "save up you can you can work really hard",
    "you can do great things for society and",
    "society will give you money for giving",
    "it things that it wants and it doesn't",
    "know how to get",
    "and then you can save that up and you",
    "can live well below with your means and",
    "you can find a certain freedom in that",
    "and that will give you the time and the",
    "energy to pursue your own internal peace",
    "and happiness",
    "so i believe the solution to making",
    "everybody happy is to give them what",
    "they want let's get them all rich let's",
    "get them all fit and healthy and then",
    "let's get them all happy",
    "is are those things even possible",
    "everyone can be rich everyone can be",
    "rich everyone here's my thought exercise",
    "for you now it seems like we're in an",
    "infomercial",
    "everyone can be writing not selling my",
    "home this is my rolls royce yeah no so",
    "that's a good point so everything that",
    "i've ever created on this topic of how",
    "to make money i will never charge a",
    "dollar for",
    "because that would ruin it that would",
    "show that i'm just another huckster",
    "who's trying to get rich off of you",
    "there are no get-rich-quick schemes",
    "that's just somebody else trying to get",
    "rich off of you right so it's so to me",
    "it's more of a philosophical",
    "contribution where for it to have",
    "meaning and to be legit i can't charge",
    "you anything for it but yes everybody",
    "can be rich and let me give you a",
    "thought exercise okay",
    "imagine if tomorrow we could wave a wand",
    "and everybody was trained",
    "as a scientist or an engineer everybody",
    "even if you weren't very good you had",
    "enough understanding of computers you",
    "could write some code you could build",
    "some hardware and don't tell me people",
    "can't do it because they can that's just",
    "the tyranny of soft expectations that's",
    "just you looking down on somebody else",
    "they can't do it they just have to be",
    "educated now if they're educated all as",
    "hardware software engineers scientists",
    "biologists technicians hard sciences not",
    "the social sciences we would all be done",
    "within five years robots would be doing",
    "everything from cleaning toilets to",
    "cooking food to flying airplanes to",
    "driving ubers and what would we be doing",
    "we would be doing all creative jobs to",
    "entertain each other and researching",
    "science and technology we would have",
    "wonderful lives so it is really just a",
    "question of education nothing else",
    "is this a scale issue though i mean",
    "you're talking about it as if this would",
    "work with 300 million people it'll work",
    "with 10 billion people it'll work with a",
    "spacefaring race with 100 trillion",
    "people just we have the resources we",
    "have",
    "the ability the universe is infinite",
    "resources you build it you know have you",
    "heard of a dyson sphere",
    "you know you pull the dyson sphere on a",
    "star and you gather all its energy like",
    "that there's so much energy out there",
    "one asteroid's got all the minerals that",
    "we need one sun one solar system has got",
    "all the power we will need for a long",
    "long time uh you know we can extract it",
    "out of nuclear fusion you know we're",
    "we're not that far from those kinds of",
    "technologies working",
    "uh it's just a question of guts and uh",
    "you know and interest like we should be",
    "building nuclear fusion test plants on",
    "the moon the moon should be littered",
    "with them it's no downside right",
    "yeah",
    "if you could",
    "how would that work well it doesn't send",
    "a bunch of people up there to work oh",
    "the problem robots the problem with",
    "fission nuclear fission is that you know",
    "nature",
    "creates energy through nuclear energy",
    "right like the sun creates energy",
    "nuclear energy now for transmission we",
    "use photons because photons don't",
    "interact and so photons are great for",
    "information transmission but they're",
    "actually not great for energy",
    "transmission for energy creation",
    "you want nuclear to work and the problem",
    "is because nuclear energy you know we",
    "built it with a bomb we have dirty nukes",
    "all those kinds of problems with",
    "fukushima three-mile island chernobyl",
    "we don't innovate anymore on nukes",
    "imagine if when the first steam engine",
    "blew up we said oh",
    "no more steam engines for a while or",
    "very carefully regulated billion dollars",
    "of regulation you can't innovate that",
    "way when the first airplane crashed we",
    "said no more innovation in airplanes",
    "right",
    "so we need a way to iterate on nuclear",
    "fission and eventually fusion and get",
    "them working safely cleanly passive say",
    "failure etc if we're going to find our",
    "way out of the energy trap and the best",
    "place to do that is someplace like on",
    "the moon or mars",
    "do you think that it's actually a",
    "possibility that they could",
    "get nuclear power to the point where",
    "it's not a detriment because what",
    "everyone's worried about is a meltdown",
    "right yeah and we do have these old",
    "plants that are running that are running",
    "on this this is 50 years old technology",
    "it's crazy because there's no ability to",
    "shut them off right very old technology",
    "they do now have gen 4 nuclear reactors",
    "that are passive fail safe so in other",
    "words when they fail they fail into us",
    "when you pull the plug on them they fail",
    "into a state where there's no leakage",
    "there's no problem right their default",
    "is a positive outcome as opposed to the",
    "current ones the old ones where if you",
    "unplug them like and these even these",
    "gen four are just gen four they're not",
    "gen five they're not gen eighty gen",
    "hundred where we're in microprocessors",
    "right and that should be something that",
    "people are working towards i hope so i",
    "mean in an ideal world we would now the",
    "problem is if you have nuclear energy on",
    "the moon how do you get it home right so",
    "what you actually got to do is you got",
    "to",
    "rev it on the moon and you're using it",
    "there maybe to launch more satellites",
    "more rockets further out into the solar",
    "system and that's the initial use case",
    "um but then eventually the technology",
    "gets so good you can bring it home",
    "now i want to go back to this idea of",
    "getting people rich that somehow or",
    "another that's going to make people",
    "happy how do you stop the the",
    "natural progression that people have of",
    "you know oh you know i have got a nice",
    "chevrolet yeah but i really want a bmw",
    "i've got a nice bmw but now i want a",
    "mercedes i have mercedes i want a",
    "ferrari",
    "how do you stop that material",
    "possession",
    "trap because you can't at some level but",
    "i think most smart people over time",
    "realize that possessions don't make them",
    "happy right it's just you have to go",
    "through that you have to buy your stupid",
    "car to realize that it doesn't attract",
    "attractive girls it actually just",
    "attracts other dudes who are like hey",
    "i like that car man right like like you",
    "have some expensive cars out there some",
    "fancy cars tell me how you know how much",
    "that attracts women versus men well i'm",
    "married those are for me",
    "i just enjoy machines yeah so for me",
    "they're toys that's a particular thing",
    "where you enjoy machines but i think",
    "very as you get older",
    "you just realize that there's no",
    "happiness in material possessions now",
    "lack of material possessions can make",
    "you very unhappy so being poor can make",
    "you unhappy but being rich is not going",
    "to make you happy",
    "and what happens unfortunately a lot of",
    "people struggle through their whole",
    "lives to make money they make some",
    "they're exhausted and then they're like",
    "well now why am i not happy i guess i'm",
    "just not a happy person and smart people",
    "aren't happy that's like a great little",
    "way to people feel better about it they",
    "say well if you're smart you're not",
    "happy right where's i positive the other",
    "way if you're smart you should be able",
    "to figure out how to be happy otherwise",
    "you're not that smart yeah that is an",
    "offensive statement that if you're smart",
    "you're not happy i've heard that before",
    "and i just do not understand the logic",
    "of that other than self-justifying i",
    "understand where it comes from it comes",
    "from if you're smart it's usually",
    "because you thought things through and",
    "you have a very busy mind yeah and so",
    "busy mind can often rob you of peace of",
    "mind",
    "because what",
    "the peace that we seek is not peace of",
    "mind it's peace from mind",
    "right so if you look at all the crazy",
    "activities you do to be happy right",
    "whether it's like trying to get laid and",
    "have an orgasm or you know extreme",
    "sports or looking at something beautiful",
    "or taking a psychedelic you're trying to",
    "get out of your own mind you're trying",
    "to get your monkey mind to stop",
    "chattering at you for a moment you're",
    "trying to get peace from the mind",
    "and there are other better ways to do",
    "that most of the ways we try to get",
    "peace from mind are indirect",
    "whereas if you understand things if you",
    "see things properly you will naturally",
    "slowly develop peace from mind",
    "sorry if i went on a tangent there no",
    "it's a good tangent it's a good tangent",
    "because i think that oftentimes",
    "the pursuit",
    "is",
    "what's thrilling to people and the",
    "possibility that one day they'll be able",
    "to rest and that they'll reach this goal",
    "that's the fundamental delusion that",
    "there is something out there that will",
    "make me happy and fulfill forever yeah",
    "golden years there is it's called death",
    "oh i'll take care of everything that's",
    "the great leveler but when people look",
    "at particularly social media bring it",
    "back to that when you see someone who",
    "you know you see them posed in front of",
    "their mansion with their beautiful car",
    "and they're leaning against it with",
    "their designer clothes on their",
    "expensive watch",
    "you go i want that right that's what i",
    "want",
    "what you really want is freedom you want",
    "freedom from your money problems right",
    "and i think that's okay so people once",
    "someone can solve their money problems",
    "either by lowering their lifestyle or by",
    "making enough money",
    "and you know",
    "essentially what you want to get",
    "everybody to the retirement but not",
    "retirement in the i'm 65 years old",
    "sitting in a nursing home collecting a",
    "check retirement different definition",
    "retirement is when you stop",
    "sacrificing today for some imaginary",
    "tomorrow",
    "okay yes when today is complete in and",
    "of itself you're retired yeah and so how",
    "do you get there well one is you can",
    "have so much money saved up that just",
    "your passive income off of that without",
    "you having to lift a finger covers your",
    "burn rate keep your burn rate low right",
    "a second is you just drive your burn",
    "rate down to zero you become a monk",
    "a third is you're doing something you",
    "love you enjoy it so much it's not about",
    "the money right so there are multiple",
    "ways to that path but the most common is",
    "people just say i need to make more",
    "money and the kind of wealth creation",
    "that i talk about is about creating",
    "timeless principles and adapting",
    "yourselves that making money won't be an",
    "issue and you can do it by doing what",
    "you love right like we get into this",
    "model of i must work for other people",
    "work my way up the ladder",
    "i must like do what that person is doing",
    "to make money but really today in",
    "society you get rewarded for creative",
    "work for creating something brand new",
    "that society didn't even know yet that",
    "it wanted it doesn't know how to get",
    "other than through you so the most",
    "powerful money makers are actually",
    "individual brands people like yourself",
    "or elon or kanye or oprah or trump right",
    "these are individual brands eponymous",
    "name brands who themselves are leveraged",
    "like you're leveraged you have podcast",
    "media going out to everybody that's",
    "leveraged the podcasts work for you when",
    "you sleep they have knowledge that",
    "nobody else has which is your knowledge",
    "is the knowledge of being joe rogan i",
    "mean who else is a ufc fighter and a",
    "commentator and a podcaster and a",
    "comedian and you know interested in all",
    "these things and those all these people",
    "can't replace you",
    "um so we have to pay you what you're",
    "worth and who's i never fought in the",
    "ufc though",
    "oh you didn't okay sorry",
    "um or you know you're whatever you're",
    "you're involved in that whole scene you",
    "just have a unique set of skill sets",
    "um so because of this unique what i call",
    "specific knowledge because of the",
    "accountability that you have with your",
    "name because the leverage that you have",
    "through your media you're a money-making",
    "machine you're",
    "i'm sure at this point i could make you",
    "start over tomorrow wipe out your bank",
    "account you'd be rich again in no time",
    "because you have all the skill sets so",
    "once people have those skill sets and",
    "the beauty is the way you've done it is",
    "you don't have any competition there's",
    "no substitution if joe rogan were to",
    "disappear off the air tomorrow it's not",
    "like random podcaster number 12 would",
    "step in and fill that thing no it's it's",
    "just gone so the way to get out of that",
    "competition trap is actually to be",
    "authentic the way to retire is actually",
    "to find the thing that you know how to",
    "do better than anybody and you know how",
    "to do that better than anybody because",
    "you love to do it no one can compete",
    "with you if you love to do it be",
    "authentic",
    "and then figure out how to map that to",
    "what society actually wants apply some",
    "leverage put your name on it so you take",
    "the risks but you gain the rewards have",
    "ownership and equity in what you do and",
    "then just crank it out i think people",
    "have to be very careful to not get",
    "trapped along the way with",
    "things that you can afford with your",
    "current lifestyle like the way you're",
    "living and the way you're earning but",
    "they're also imprisoning you and the",
    "fact that you are now going to have to",
    "work this 40-hour a week job in order to",
    "get this thing that you can't afford but",
    "now you you're saddled down to this job",
    "you've no you're not saving you're not",
    "you're not putting things in a good",
    "place and you're working for these",
    "things",
    "working for things as rewards is a real",
    "trap that a lot of people fall into it's",
    "the biggest one you know naseem tell",
    "that also says that uh you know under",
    "two great addictions heroin and a",
    "monthly salary",
    "right",
    "and and that's why you can't get rich",
    "writing out your time because even when",
    "you start charging more and more for",
    "your time it's a slow upgrade loop and",
    "then you upgrade your house at the same",
    "time you break your car at the same time",
    "you move in the neighborhood you really",
    "also have to get used to ignoring your",
    "peers",
    "or upgrading or changing the definition",
    "of your peers",
    "a lot of people here who are poor here",
    "but they would be rich if they were",
    "living in thailand and bali and if they",
    "have the luxury of a remotely doable job",
    "they may want to be living there",
    "and saving up money but the ignoring the",
    "peers is an issue because the keeping up",
    "with the joneses is a real phenomenon",
    "yeah envy makes the world go around",
    "right yeah",
    "and then there's a there's another thing",
    "that people have to avoid even allowing",
    "their mind to think when they're hearing",
    "what you're saying and all this",
    "logical fantastic advice",
    "there's these six dirty words that's",
    "easy for you to say yeah that is a",
    "terrible trap i mean look i grew up as a",
    "first generation immigrant uh in jamaica",
    "queens uh with zero money single mom two",
    "kids working day and night going to",
    "school",
    "uh you know i washed dishes uh i was k i",
    "was working catering jobs i was mowing",
    "lawns i was working since the age of 11",
    "on and off here and there um",
    "didn't have two cents to rub together",
    "you know",
    "i had to borrow 400 to go to college",
    "like literally i was short 400 dollars",
    "400. i had to find 400 i didn't have it",
    "um you know got rejected from a job at",
    "dunkin donuts so like okay",
    "it's not to say that it's easy it's not",
    "easy it's actually really freaking hard",
    "it is the hardest thing you will do but",
    "it's also the rewarding thing you know",
    "look at the kids who are born rich no",
    "meaning to their lives you're a terrible",
    "place yeah your real your real resume is",
    "just a cataloguing of all your suffering",
    "right if i were to ask you to describe",
    "your real life to yourself when you look",
    "back on your deathbed you're going to go",
    "back and say what are the interesting",
    "things i've done and it's all going to",
    "be around the sacrifices that you made",
    "and the hard things that you did",
    "anything you're given doesn't matter",
    "you know you you have your four limbs",
    "you have your brain you have your head",
    "you have your skin that's that's all for",
    "granted so you have to do hard things",
    "anyway to create your own meaning in",
    "life",
    "um",
    "making money is a fine one yeah struggle",
    "it is hard i'm not gonna say it's easy",
    "it's a really hard but the tools are all",
    "available it's all there there's also",
    "these these traps that people",
    "sort of establish in their own mind",
    "of",
    "giving themselves excuses or giving",
    "themselves in insurmountable",
    "obstacles insurmountable",
    "paths victorian victim mentality yes",
    "it's somebody else's fault it's my skin",
    "color's fault it's the system's fault",
    "yeah those people are sinking i feel bad",
    "for them i want to shake them out of it",
    "and say actually you can get out of it",
    "you just have to stop thinking it's",
    "everybody you have to alter the",
    "perspective yeah but it's so difficult",
    "for people to do it's one of the most",
    "difficult things for people to do is to",
    "change the way they approach approach",
    "reality itself",
    "at the end of the day i i do think even",
    "despite what i said earlier life is",
    "really a single player game it's all",
    "going on in your head you know whatever",
    "you think you believe",
    "will very much shape your reality both",
    "from what risks you take and what",
    "actions you perform but also just your",
    "everyday experience of reality if you're",
    "walking down the street and you're",
    "judging everyone you're like i don't",
    "like that person because their skin",
    "color i don't like that oh she's she's",
    "not attractive that guy's fat this",
    "person's a loser oh who put this in my",
    "way uh you know the more you judge the",
    "more you're gonna separate yourself and",
    "you'll feel good for an instant because",
    "you'll feel good about yourself i'm",
    "better than that but then you're gonna",
    "feel lonely and then you're just gonna",
    "see negativity everywhere the world just",
    "reflects your own feelings back at you",
    "reality is neutral",
    "reality has no judgments to a tree",
    "there's no concept of right or wrong or",
    "good or bad right you're born you have a",
    "whole set of sensory experiences and",
    "stimulations and lights and colors and",
    "sounds and then you die yeah and how you",
    "choose to interpret that is up to you",
    "you do have that choice so this is what",
    "i meant that happiness is a choice if",
    "you believe it's the choice then you can",
    "start working on it and i can't tell you",
    "how to find it because",
    "it's your own conditionings that are",
    "making you unhappy so you have to",
    "uncondition yourself it's just like i",
    "can't fix your eating habits for you can",
    "give you some general guidelines but you",
    "gotta go through the hard habit forming",
    "of how to eat right but you have to",
    "believe it's possible and it is",
    "absolutely possible i was miserable i'm",
    "happy as a clam it's not just the money",
    "i got there before the money you got",
    "happy before the money mostly yeah how",
    "did you get happy before the money i",
    "started getting older you know i just",
    "realized like life is short i'm going to",
    "die",
    "again trite right try it in 20 ways yeah",
    "well confucius had a great saying that",
    "uh you know every man has two lives and",
    "the second starts when he realizes he",
    "has just one",
    "wow",
    "and i read that it was one of those book",
    "dropping lines you know it's like mic",
    "drop confucius had a lot of mic drops",
    "fuchsias was a bad [ __ ] he was",
    "that's a crazy one that was a great one",
    "um or another one is next time you get",
    "sick you know because everybody gets",
    "sick every now and then it's like a",
    "happy person",
    "wants 10 000 things a sick person just",
    "wants one thing",
    "right so it's your it's your unlimited",
    "desires that are clouding your peace",
    "your happiness",
    "have desires your biological creature",
    "stands up and says i can do something i",
    "i move i resist i live",
    "but",
    "just be very careful of your desires",
    "this is the oldest most trite wisdom",
    "desire is suffering that's what it means",
    "right every desire you have is an access",
    "where you will suffer so just don't",
    "focus on more than one desire at a time",
    "the universe is rigged in such a way",
    "that if you just want one thing and you",
    "focus on that you'll get it but",
    "everything else you gotta let go",
    "did you make a gradual shift to",
    "happiness or was it a radical change",
    "it's ongoing it's gradual every day so",
    "you're happier today than you were a",
    "month ago yeah allegedly yeah",
    "yeah i'm i'm very happy these days",
    "deliriously so it's actually hard for me",
    "to hang out with normal people really",
    "yeah so you you've made a significant",
    "shift",
    "over the period of like how many years",
    "about eight years eight years yeah",
    "wow and",
    "is this something that you've pursued",
    "through certain books or is it just like",
    "you you've made an understanding or",
    "gained an understanding in your own mind",
    "and then started pursuing it based on",
    "that understanding yeah it's very very",
    "personal uh it's basically you have to",
    "decide it's a priority and then i tried",
    "every hack i possibly could i used to",
    "you know i tried all the i tried",
    "meditation i tried witnessing uh you",
    "know i even tried an ssri just to see",
    "what it would feel like how did it feel",
    "uh it was it turned me from a pessimist",
    "to an optimist but i didn't like the",
    "physical side effects nor did i want to",
    "be on a drug for a sustained basis",
    "so i dropped it and i did turn you into",
    "an optimist yes at the time i used to be",
    "a pessimist yeah",
    "um i started doing things like i would",
    "start looking at the you know in every",
    "moment and everything that happens you",
    "can look on the bright side of something",
    "right and so i used to do that forcibly",
    "and then i trained it until it became",
    "second nature so for example like a",
    "friend of my wife's was over and she",
    "when we were dating and she took all",
    "these photos she took like hundreds of",
    "photos and then she sends them all to us",
    "and my immediate reaction was like why",
    "are you dumping hundreds of photos of my",
    "phone i don't need hundreds of photos",
    "have some judgment that's my immediate",
    "reaction and then i could say actually",
    "how nice of her she sent me hundreds of",
    "photos i can pick the one that i like",
    "right there are two ways of seeing",
    "almost everything there are a few things",
    "that are like high suffering so you",
    "can't do that other than just saying",
    "well this is a teacher right but i",
    "slowly worked through every negative",
    "judgment that i had until i saw the",
    "positive end now it's second nature to",
    "me i also realized that like what you",
    "want is you want to clear minds you want",
    "to let go of thoughts",
    "happy thoughts disappear out ahead",
    "automatically very easy to let go of",
    "them negative thoughts linger so if you",
    "interpret then the positive and",
    "everything very quickly you let it go",
    "right you let it go much faster",
    "simple hacks get more sunlight right",
    "learn to smile more learn to hug more",
    "these things actually release serotonin",
    "in reverse they aren't just outward",
    "signals of being happy they're actually",
    "feedback loops to being happy",
    "spend more time in nature you know these",
    "are obvious watch your mind watch your",
    "mind all day long watch what it does not",
    "judge it not try to control it but you",
    "can meditate 24 7. meditation is not a",
    "sit down close your eyes activity",
    "meditation is just basically watching",
    "your own thoughts like you would watch",
    "anything else in the outside world and",
    "say why am i having that thought does",
    "that serve me anymore is that",
    "conditioning from when i was 10 years",
    "old like for example",
    "getting ready for this podcast you got",
    "ready i didn't but good i did but i did",
    "but i did i couldn't help it and what",
    "happened was the few days leading up to",
    "this my mind was just running and",
    "normally my mind is pretty calm and it",
    "was just running and running and running",
    "and every thought i would have i would",
    "imagine me saying it to you my brain",
    "couldn't help but rehearse",
    "what what it's doing it's just",
    "rehearsing all the time to talk to you",
    "and then i was even rehearsing rehearse",
    "telling you about the rehearsal right so",
    "it was all playing all these meta games",
    "and i was just like shut up stop it what",
    "is going on and it took me a while to",
    "figure out oh yeah you know what it is",
    "when i was a kid in queens and i had no",
    "money and i had nothing and i needed to",
    "save myself the way i got out was by",
    "sounding smart not being smart sounding",
    "smart that was the skill i perfected so",
    "i am hardwired to always rehearse things",
    "so i will sound smart it's a disease it",
    "keeps me from being happy so but when",
    "you see that when you realize that when",
    "you understand something then it",
    "naturally calms you down so after that i",
    "stopped rehearsing as much",
    "wow but it's still a train habit",
    "that is a really interesting point that",
    "you",
    "want to sound smart",
    "that that many people do that and",
    "especially young people when you you see",
    "someone who is smart or someone who",
    "appears smart they say smart things oh",
    "god i want to sound smart i want people",
    "to think about me the same way i think",
    "about that person that that is my",
    "disease that is my feeling it is what",
    "clutters my mind i the the thing i have",
    "to ask myself now is",
    "if i can",
    "would i still be interested in learning",
    "this thing if i couldn't ever tell",
    "anybody about it",
    "that's how i know it's real that's how i",
    "know it's something i actually want to",
    "know that's a common thing though i know",
    "i suffered from that when i was young",
    "the desire to sound smart",
    "that's it's very",
    "it's very common well all of us start",
    "out",
    "you know",
    "every everything you're a winner now in",
    "your life you were to lose because you",
    "were a loser at some point right if if",
    "you had gotten all the girls if you had",
    "all the money if you had everything you",
    "want you were good looking and in junior",
    "high or high school uh you wouldn't have",
    "done anything with your life",
    "and you would have peaked early it's",
    "like the bruce springsteen glory days",
    "song right you would have married your",
    "high school sweetheart you'd be living",
    "in your hometown you know you'd be a",
    "manager at the local mcdonald's whatever",
    "the first dream job you had thank god we",
    "didn't all get what we wanted when we",
    "were young right or we would be trapped",
    "in that so you have to be able to break",
    "out of where you came from i don't know",
    "where i was going that is interesting",
    "too about people who peak too early yeah",
    "or maybe those people that peak too",
    "early can do the elon musk thing and",
    "just abandon it and start something new",
    "and then learn the the the joys of",
    "sucking at something yeah and actually",
    "though",
    "in our professions especially when",
    "you're high visibility the problem with",
    "peaking is that you then get drowned in",
    "death of a thousand cuts people have",
    "expectations of you hey joe can you come",
    "to my event hey joe can you look at my",
    "business plan hey joe can give me advice",
    "on this can you you know talk to my",
    "friend can you come in this podcast",
    "you're just being assaulted all the time",
    "with inbound opportunities so you have",
    "no time to start over with anything so",
    "you have to ruthlessly ruthlessly",
    "disappoint everybody eliminate and clear",
    "your schedule drop all the meetings not",
    "even respond to the emails the only way",
    "you're gonna be able to start over with",
    "anything",
    "yeah and i we talked about this that i'd",
    "love your approach to meetings",
    "if they're not meeting life or death i'm",
    "the same way",
    "i avoided a good one recently and this",
    "was someone that was just",
    "tracking me down as a high-profile",
    "person in a big organization and i'm",
    "like can we just talk on the phone and",
    "then we talk on the phone there was",
    "nothing to say it was just they wanted",
    "to get me in the office and yeah and the",
    "meetings should really be phone calls",
    "phone calls should be emails and emails",
    "should just be text",
    "right",
    "many of them right with meetings i i",
    "mean i i despise meetings i used to own",
    "the domain i don't do coffee.com i",
    "eventually let go but i used to respond",
    "from the wallet i don't do coffee you",
    "know oh that's hilarious but it was a",
    "little bit of a jerk move but really",
    "where it comes from is when i was young",
    "one of my principles was i knew i had to",
    "make money it was my overwhelming desire",
    "and",
    "one of the things i did was i said okay",
    "i'm never going to be worth more than",
    "what i think i'm worth okay no one's",
    "going to pay me more than what i think",
    "i'm worth so what am i worth so i i",
    "picked an hourly rate for myself that i",
    "was worth and i said i'm never going to",
    "squander my time for less than this so",
    "if",
    "originally there's 500 bucks an hour",
    "then i upgrade to 5000 bucks an hour and",
    "it's ludicrous but",
    "pick an aspirational hourly rate",
    "aspirational it has to be a little",
    "ludicrous and then what i would do is if",
    "i have to return something i'm standing",
    "in line to return something and it's",
    "below my hourly rate i'll throw it away",
    "if i have to if i or give it away if i",
    "have to do some tasks and i can hire",
    "somebody to do it for less than my",
    "hourly rate i would hire them and so i",
    "just became extremely jealous of my time",
    "which doesn't mean you can't have fun",
    "rest leisure spending time with your",
    "friends and family that's all great",
    "don't count that but if you're doing",
    "anything you don't want to do which is",
    "the definition of work it's a set of",
    "things that you have to do that you",
    "don't want to do if you're working it",
    "better be for your hourly rate otherwise",
    "don't do the work and so",
    "once it came out of that then i just",
    "realized the cost of meetings the cost",
    "of meetings is so high especially given",
    "all the people who are in there right",
    "one person is talking seven people",
    "listening you're literally just dying an",
    "hour at a time",
    "so you have to just",
    "drop non-urgent meetings or figure out",
    "how to be more efficient with them if",
    "you're gonna do anything great",
    "the extreme example is business travel",
    "getting on a plane to fly halfway around",
    "the world for one meeting which never",
    "amounts to anything",
    "and then like wasting your whole little",
    "life there and then flying back so about",
    "five years ago i resolved i am never",
    "going to travel for business",
    "wow and i haven't tried for business",
    "since i only travel",
    "if the travel experience will be so",
    "entertaining and joyous because i have",
    "friends or it's a place i want to see or",
    "whatever that it will be complete in and",
    "of itself because i know that whatever",
    "the business meeting i came from is",
    "never worth it",
    "wow",
    "and actually that principle applies",
    "larger than just travel it applies to",
    "life in general the this one of the",
    "secrets to happiness is to really",
    "embrace what you're doing in that moment",
    "that's trite but where that where that",
    "comes from is saying i only want to do",
    "actions that are complete in and of",
    "themselves right if i'm looking for some",
    "ulterior motive down the line",
    "it's not going to materialize",
    "and and if you think it is maybe even if",
    "it does it'll be very short-lived",
    "anything you wanted in your life whether",
    "it was a car or whether it was a girl or",
    "there was money",
    "when you got it a year later you were",
    "back to zero your brain had hedonically",
    "adapted to it and you were looking for",
    "the next thing",
    "that's a great statement hedonically",
    "adapted",
    "that's that is what happens to people",
    "you get accustomed to whatever it is i",
    "realized that when i first got a new",
    "apartment it was a nice apartment after",
    "a while i got used to it i was like oh",
    "okay this is just an apartment it's just",
    "where i live i'm used to it's nice but",
    "i'm used to it yeah we all go through",
    "this learning it's it's you know it's",
    "riding the ferris wheel of life it's",
    "like you get at the bottom like i want",
    "to get the top this is so exciting you",
    "ride it up you get a little dopamine",
    "rush and get a little serotonin then you",
    "ride it back down as that wears off then",
    "you need another high then you ride it",
    "back up and write it back down in fact",
    "the more highs you get the harder it",
    "gets to go around the wheel and the more",
    "board you get it the harder it goes to",
    "go back up",
    "so what lights your fire now like what",
    "what gets you motivated to do things and",
    "to act art art this is art oh okay art",
    "is just creativity it's just anything",
    "that's done for its own sake",
    "so what are the things that are done for",
    "their own sake there's nothing beyond",
    "loving somebody",
    "uh creating something",
    "playing",
    "art to me creating business is play i",
    "create businesses early stage because",
    "it's fun because i i'm into the product",
    "even when i invest it's because i like",
    "the people i like hanging out with them",
    "i learn from them and i think the",
    "product is really cool",
    "so these days i will pass on all kinds",
    "of great investments because i'm like i",
    "just the product's not interesting it's",
    "boring i'm not gonna learn anything",
    "that's a beautiful luxury it is a luxury",
    "art and learning yeah it is a luxury",
    "these are not 100 or zero things right",
    "you can in your life start moving more",
    "and more towards that right but that's a",
    "goal it's a goal when i was younger i",
    "used to be so desperate to make money",
    "that i would have done anything right if",
    "you'd shown up and said hey i got a",
    "sewage trucking business and you're",
    "going to go into that i said great let's",
    "do it i'm going to make money",
    "thank god no one gave me that",
    "opportunity",
    "i'm glad that it went down the road of",
    "technology and science which i genuinely",
    "enjoy",
    "and so i got to like combine my vocation",
    "and my advocation i mean what are you",
    "doing you're playing you're having fun",
    "you're doing art you're not you're not",
    "working no that's what i always say when",
    "people say i work hard i'm like sorta",
    "not really i'm always working but it",
    "looks like work to them but it feels",
    "like play to me and that's how i know no",
    "one can compete with me on it",
    "because i'm just playing 16 hours a day",
    "and if they want to compete with me and",
    "they're going to work they're going to",
    "lose because they're not going to do it",
    "16 hours a day seven days a week",
    "well listen man there are some gems of",
    "wisdom in this conversation and i hope",
    "people pull things out of this and apply",
    "them to their own life and i'm certainly",
    "going to listen to you again and and and",
    "try to apply some of this to my own life",
